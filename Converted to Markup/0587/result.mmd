## AIR BAG SYSTEM SYMPTOM TROUBLESHOOTING  


## Foreword  


Refer to section GI and thoroughly read and understand the basic flow of troubleshooting in order to properly perform the procedures. For the steps that have an asterisk \((^{\ast})\) , inspect the connector/terminal connection for continuity and damage. If the connection is poor, reconnect it, or repair or replace the appropriate parts if necessary.  


## Troubleshooting Index  


Use the chart below to verify the symptoms of the trouble in order to diagnose the appropriate area.

## Symptom Troubleshooting  


## Note  


The following may be the cause of trouble if the symptom does not go away after the symptom troubleshooting steps are followed.  


1. Poor contact at terminal D of short connector (6-pin) between instrument cluster and SAS control module. 
2. Simultaneous poor contact at terminals A and F of short connector (6-pin) between A/B 10 A fuse and the SAS control module, ENGINE 15 A fuse and the SAS control module.  


3. Simultaneous poor contact at terminals S and X of SAS control module connector (21-pin).  


4. Simultaneous poor contact at terminals AB and Z of SAS control module connector (21-pin).  


5. Simultaneous poor contact in wiring harness between terminal S of SAS control module connector (21-pin) and ground, terminal X of SAS control module connector (21-pin) and ground.  


6. Simultaneous poor contact in wiring harness between A/B 10 A fuse and the SAS control module, ENGINE 15 A fuse andthe SAS control module.
