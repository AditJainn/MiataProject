# 6 LOW MAXIMUM SPEED AND POOR ACCELERATION  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


If the clutch is stuck or does not stay in 3GR or 4GR, the malfunction is in the engine circuit.  


\(①\) Clutch slippage, burned  


Line pressure is low Malfunction of throttle position sensor Malfunction of output speed sensor Malfunction of input/turbine speed sensor Malfunction of sensor ground Malfunction of shift solenoid A and/or B Malfunction of body ground Malfunction of control valve body  


\(②\) Transmission is fixed in 3GR or 4GR (Operation of fail- safe function)  


Short or open circuit in wiring Poor connection of connector  


Malfunction of the electronic parts of output and input system  


\(③\) Insufficient starting torque (Suspected when in gear condition, shift control and engine circuit are normal)  


Malfunction of torque converter (Poor operation, sticking)  


\(④\) Engagement of TCC operation range (Operation of fail- safe function)  


Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.
