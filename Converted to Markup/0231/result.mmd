## VICS SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "VICS Operation Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, VICS Operation Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the VICS solenoid valve.  


## Airflow Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Remove the VICS solenoid valve. 
2. Inspect for airflow between each port under the following condition.
