10. Select the following items.  


SEGRP RPM VS TP V ECT V  


11. Let the vehicle idle and verify that the SEGRP value is 0.  


12. Depress the accelerator pedal and verify that the SEGRP value is increased.  


13. If the SEGRP value will not increased, do as follows.  


(1) Verify that the TP V value is increased when the accelerator pedal is depressed. 
(2) Verify that the VS is increased when the tires are rotated. 
(3) Verify that the ECT V is within the specified value when the engine warms up. (Refer to 01-40 POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) INSPECTION.) 
(4) If not as specified, inspect the following. 
- Throttle position sensor 
- Vehicle speed sensor 
- Engine coolant temperature sensor 
- Wiring harnesses and connectors (PCM—throttle position sensor, PCM—vehicle speed sensor, PCM—engine coolant temperature sensor)  


14. Stop the vehicle and verify that the SEGRP is returned 0.  


## Main Relay Operation Inspection  


1. Verify that the main relay clicks when the ignition switch is turned to ON and off.  


2. If there is no operation sound, inspect the following.  


Main relay Harness and connector between ignition switch and main relay Main relay ground  


## Ignition Timing Control Inspection  


1. Connect a timing light to the engine. 
2. Crank the engine. 
3. Verify that the timing mark (yellow) on the crankshaft pulley and the mark on the timing belt cover are aligned.  


## Specification  


\[\mathsf{BTDC}9^{\circ} - 11^{\circ}(10^{\circ}\pm 1^{\circ})\]  


4. Increase engine speed and verify ignition timing is advanced.  


## A/C Cut Control Inspection  


1. Start the engine.  


2. Turn the A/C switch and fan switch on.  


3. Verify that the A/C compressor magnet clutch actuates.  


4. If is does not actuate, go to symptom  


troubleshooting No.23 "A/C does not work".  


5. Fully open the throttle valve and verify that the A/C compressor magnet clutch does not actuate for 3-6 seconds.  


6. If it actuates, inspect the following.  


(1) Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2.

(2) Turn the A/C switch off.  


(3) Turn the ignition switch to ON.  


(4) Select "SIMULATION TEST" and press TRIGGER.  


(5) Select "IG ON TEST" and press TRIGGER.  


(6) Select "A/C RLY" and press TRIGGER.  


(7) Press START.  


(8) Turn the A/C relay from off to on and inspect if the operation sound of the relay is heard.  


(9) If the operation sound is heard, inspect TP V PID.  


(10) If the operation sound is not heard, inspect following.  


A/C relay  


Open or short to ground circuit in wiring harness and connectors (Main relay—A/C relay—PCM terminal 1S.)
