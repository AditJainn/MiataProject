## FILAMENT INSPECTION  


1. Turn the ignition switch to ON. 
2. Turn the rear window defroster switch on.  


## Caution  


Directly touching the rear window defroster filament with the lead of the circuit tester will damage it. Wrap aluminum foil around the end of the lead and test the filament by touching it with the foil.

3. Connect the positive \((+)\) lead of the voltmeter to the positive side of each filament and the negative \((-)\) lead to ground.  


17. Use white gasoline to remove any excess sealant. 
18. Install the front header trim. (Refer to 09-17 FRONT HEADER TRIM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
19. Install the striker. (Refer to 09-16 CONVERTIBLE TOP DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY.) (Refer to 09-16 DETACHABLE HARDTOP DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY.) 
20. Install the cowl grille. (Refer to 09-17 COWL GRILLE REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
21. Install the A-pillar trim. (Refer to 09-17 A-PILLAR TRIM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
22. Install the base. (Refer to 09-12 BASE INSTALLATION.) 
23. Install the rearview mirror. (Refer to 09-12 REARVIEW MIRROR INSTALLATION.)  


## FILAMENT INSPECTION  


4. Gradually, slide the positive \((+)\) lead from the positive side to the negative side and measure the voltage. Verify that the voltage decrease accordingly.  



<table><tr><td>Measurement place</td><td>Voltage (Reference value)</td></tr><tr><td>(1) → (2)</td><td>Approx. 12 V → Approx. 0 V</td></tr></table>

5. If the voltage is not as specified or it changes rapidly, the filament is faulty. Repair the filament.
