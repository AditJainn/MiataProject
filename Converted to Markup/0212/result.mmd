## Idle-up Speed Inspection  


1. Perform "Engine Tune-up Preparation", "Idle Speed Adjustment". 
2. Press SET UP and turn the test mode off (press OFF). 
3. Press CANCEL. 
4. Press START. 
5. Verify that the idle speed is normal. 
6. Verify that the idle-up speed is within the specification.

\(^{*1}\) : Excludes temporary idle speed drop just after the electrical loads (E/L) are turned on. \(^{*2}\) : Headlight is on, Fan switch (above 1st), Cooling fan are operating. Rear window defroster is on. \(^{*3}\) : Steering wheel is fully turned. \(^{*4}\) : A/C switch and fan switch are on.  


7. If not as specified with all loads conditions, inspect the idle air control valve. If not as specified with some load conditions, inspect related input switches, harnesses and connectors.  


## Idle Mixture Inspection  


1. Perform "Engine Tune-up Preparation". 
2. Verify that the idle speed and ignition timing are within the specification.  


3. Insert an exhaust gas analyzer to the tailpipe.  


4. Verify that the CO and HC concentrations are within the regulation.  


5. If not, inspect the following.  


On-board diagnostic system Heated oxygen sensor Intake manifold vacuum Fuel line pressure Ignition timing control  


6. If the systems are normal, replace the following. California emission regulation applicable model: Warm up three way catalytic converter. Except california model: Three way catalytic converter.
