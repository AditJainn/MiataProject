## FUEL INJECTOR INSPECTION  


## On-vehicle Inspection  


1. Warm up the engine and let it idle. 
2. Listen for operational sound of each fuel injector with a screwdriver or a soundscope.  


## Note  


Note- The best way to judge the performance of a fuel injector is to compare its sound with the sound of other fuel injectors.  


3. If no sound is heard, carry out the "Fuel Injector Resistance Inspection".  


## Resistance Inspection  


## Note  


Note- Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the fuel injector connectors. 
2. Measure the resistance of the fuel injector by using an ohmmeter.

## Resistance  


12- 16 \(\Omega\) [20C[68F]]  


3. If not as specified, replace the fuel injector. If as specified but On-vehicle Inspection is failed, inspect following:  


## Open circuit  


Open circuit- Ground circuit (No.1 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3W)- Ground circuit (No.2 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3X)- Ground circuit (No.3 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3Y)- Ground circuit (No.4 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3Z)- Power circuit (No.1 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal A and main relay connector terminal D through common connector)- Power circuit (No.2 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal A and main relay connector terminal D through common connector)  


Power circuit (No.3 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal A and main relay connector terminal D through common connector)- Power circuit(No.4 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal A and main relay connector terminal D through common connector)

## Short circuit  


Short circuit- No.1 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3W to ground.- No.2 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3X to ground.- No.3 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3Y to ground.- No.4 cylinder fuel injector connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3Z to ground.  


## Fuel Leakage Test  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


1. Complete the "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE". (Refer to 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
3. Remove the dynamic chamber. (Refer to 01-13 INTAKE-AIR SYSTEM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
4. Remove the fuel injectors together with the fuel distributor. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
5. Fasten the fuel injectors firmly to the fuel distributor with wire.
