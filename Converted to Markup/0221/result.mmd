## ENGINE COOLANT LEAKAGE INSPECTION  


1. Inspect the coolant level. (Refer to 01-12 ENGINE COOLANT LEVEL INSPECTION.) 
2. Remove the radiator cap. 
3. Connect a radiator cap tester and the SST to the radiator filler neck.

## RADIATOR CAP INSPECTION  


1. Attach the radiator cap to a radiator cap tester with the SST. Apply pressure gradually.

## Caution  


Applying more than \(123\mathrm{kPa}\) {1.25 kgf/cm², 17.8 psi} can damage the hoses, fittings, and other components, and cause leaks.  


4. Apply pressure to the radiator.  


## Pressure  


\(123\mathrm{kPa}\) {1.25 kgf/cm², 17.8 psi}  


5. Verify that the pressure is held. If not, inspect the system for coolant leakage.  


2. Verify that the pressure becomes stable within the specification.  


## Pressure  


\(94 - 122\mathrm{kPa}\) {0.95—1.25 kgf/cm², 13.5—17.7 psi}  


3. If the pressure is held for 10 seconds, the radiator cap is normal.
