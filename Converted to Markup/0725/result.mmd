## FUEL GAUGE SENDER UNIT INSPECTION  


1. Remove the fuel pump. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL PUMP REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
2. Using an ohmmeter, measure and verify the resistance between the fuel gauge sender unit terminals as shown in the following chart while slowly moving the unit arm from empty to full.  



<table><tr><td>Measuring point</td><td>Resistance (Ω)</td></tr><tr><td>Full</td><td>6.4—7.6</td></tr><tr><td>1/2</td><td>31.8—33.2</td></tr><tr><td>Empty</td><td>93—97</td></tr></table>

3. If not as specified, replace the fuel gauge sender unit. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL PUMP REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.  


## OIL PRESSURE SWITCH INSPECTION  


1. Verify that the oil pressure gauge needle moves to H when the engine is started. 
2. Verify that the oil pressure gauge needle moves to L when the engine is stopped. 
3. If the oil pressure gauge needle does not move, inspect the oil pressure gauge and related wiring harness.  


4. If the oil pressure gauge and related wiring harness are normal, inspect the oil pressure. (Refer to 01-11 OIL PRESSURE INSPECTION.) 
5. If the oil pressure is normal, replace the oil pressure switch. (Refer to 01-11 OIL PRESSURE INSPECTION.)  


## HORN REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Remove the upper seal board. 
3. Disconnect the horn connector. 
4. Remove the bolt. 
5. Remove the horn.

6. Install in the reverse order of removal.  


## HORN RELAY INSPECTION  


1. Remove the horn relay. 
2. Inspect for continuity between the horn relay terminals by using an ohmmeter.
