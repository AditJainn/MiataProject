## Differential Case Disassembly Note  


## Caution  


The differential case is made of aluminum, and is therefore easily dented and scratched by metal tools. When separating the differential carrier from the case, use only a plastic hammer at the point shown in the figure.  


Strike the differential carrier with a plastic hammer to separate it from the case.  


## Differential Gear Component Disassembly Note  


Mount the differential gear component on the SSTs.

## Bearing Caps Disassembly Note  


Mark one bearing cap and the carrier.  


## Adjusting Nuts Disassembly Note  


Mark one adjusting nut and the carrier.  


## Knock Pin (Standard) Disassembly Note  


Secure the gear case in a vise and tap out the knock pin toward the ring gear side.

## Bearing Inner Races (Side Bearing) Disassembly Note  


## Note  


Mark the bearings so that they can later be reinstalled in the same position.  


Remove the bearing inner races (side bearing) from the gear case by using the SST.
