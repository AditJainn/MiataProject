## Current  


1. Verify that the battery is fully charged. 
2. Verify that the drive belt deflection/tension is correct. (Refer to 01-10 DRIVE BELT INSPECTION.) 
3. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
4. Connect a circuit tester, capable of reading 120 A or over, between generator terminal B and the wiring harness. 
5. Connect the negative battery cable. 
6. Turn all electrical loads off. 
7. Start the engine and increase the engine speed to 2,000-2,500 rpm. 
8. Turn the following electrical loads on and verify that the current reading increases. 
- Headlights 
- Blower motor 
- Rear window defroster  


## Note  


- Current required for generating power varies with electrical loads applied.  


## Standard current (Reference)
