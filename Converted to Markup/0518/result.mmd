If the play exceeds specification, either the steering joints are worn or the backlash of the steering gear is excessive. With the wheels in the straight- ahead position, gently turn the steering wheel to the left and right and verify that the play is within specification.  


Play 0- 30 mm (0- 1.18 in)
