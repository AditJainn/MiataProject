2. Measure the #2 sensor terminal voltage and confirm that it is at 0 V or 5 V when the ignition switch is at ON and the engine at idle.  


(1) If it is at 0 V or 5 V, proceed to "Intermittent Diagnostic Test". 
(2) If not, inspect the following points concerning the sensor connector: If there are no problems, proceed to next step. 
● Female terminal opening loose 
● Coupler (pin holder) damage 
● Pin discoloration (blackness) 
● Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


3. Confirm that the #3 terminal switch voltage is at 0 V.  


(1) If it is at 0 V, inspect the sensor. If necessary, replace the sensor.  


(2) If not at 0 V, inspect the following points:  


Open circuit in harness 
Female terminal opening loose 
Coupler (pin holder) damage 
Pin discoloration (blackness) 
Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected.  


## Inspection Using an Oscilloscope (Reference) Purpose  


By using an oscilloscope, inspection such as a stuck solenoid valve is made possible without actually removing parts.

## When normal  


Counter electromotive voltage A, generated when the three- way solenoid valve or the fuel injector is turned off from on, shows irregular convergence because induced electromotive voltage B, generated by the plunger return operation, is added to it.  


## When plunger stuck  


When the plunger is stuck, pulse convergence is smooth because no induced electromotive voltage B is generated.
