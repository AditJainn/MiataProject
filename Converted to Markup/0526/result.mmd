## Pinion Shaft Assembly Note  


1. Apply grease to the inner race of the upper bearing and install it to the pinion shaft. 
2. Apply grease to the teeth of the pinion shaft.

## Rear Cover Assembly Note  


Rear Cover Assembly Note1. Apply grease to the outer race of the upper bearing and install it in the gear housing.2. Install a new oil seal to the rear cover.3. Apply sealant to the threads of the rear cover and install it into the gear housing.4. Rotate the pinion to the left and right a few times to seat the bearing.5. Tighten the rear cover so that the starting torque of the pinion is \(2.0 - 3.4 \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m}\) \(\{20 - 35 \mathrm{kgf} \cdot \mathrm{cm}, 18 - 30 \mathrm{in} \cdot \mathrm{lbf}\}\) (Pull scale reading: \(20 - 34 \mathrm{N}\) \(\{2.0 - 3.5 \mathrm{kgf}, 4.4 - 7.7 \mathrm{lbf}\}\) as inspected by using the SST and a pull scale.

6. Tighten the locknut. Do not allow the rear cover to turn.  


Tightening torque 50- 68 N·m \(\{5.0 - 7.0 \mathrm{kgf} \cdot \mathrm{m}, 37 - 50 \mathrm{ft} \cdot \mathrm{lbf}\}\)  


3. Tighten the adjusting cover to \(9.8 \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m}\) \(\{100 \mathrm{kgf} \cdot \mathrm{cm}, 87 \mathrm{in} \cdot \mathrm{lbf}\}\) , then loosen it \(25^{\circ} - 45^{\circ}\) . Use the SSTs to secure the adjusting cover and the locknut.  


Tightening torque 40- 58 N·m \(\{4.0 - 6.0 \mathrm{kgf} \cdot \mathrm{m}, 29 - 43 \mathrm{ft} \cdot \mathrm{lbf}\}\)

4. Measure the starting torque of the pinion by using the SST.  


Center position \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) 1.0- 1.1 N·m \(\{9.5 - 11.5 \mathrm{kgf} \cdot \mathrm{cm}, 8.3 - 9.9 \mathrm{in} \cdot \mathrm{lbf}\}\)
