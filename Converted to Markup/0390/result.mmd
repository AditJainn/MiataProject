## Master Cylinder Installation Note Non ABS model  


1. Measure the clearance between the push rod of the power brake unit and the piston of the master cylinder.  


(1) Place the SST at the top of the master cylinder. Turn the adjusting bolt until it contacts the bottom of the piston.

(2) Apply a \(66.7\mathrm{kPa}\) (500 mmHg, 19.7 inHg) vacuum to the power brake unit by using a vacuum pump.

(3) Invert the SST used in step 1, and place it on the power brake unit.  


(4) Measure the clearance between the end of the adjusting bolt and the push rod of the power brake unit. If it is not \(0\mathrm{mm}\) (0 in), loosen the push rod locknut and turn the push rod to make the adjustment.

2. By making the above adjustment, the clearance between the push rod and piston (after installation of the brake master cylinder and the power brake unit) will be as shown in the table below.  



<table><tr><td>Condition</td><td>Clearance</td></tr><tr><td>When vacuum applied to unit is approx. 66.7 kPa (500 mmHg, 19.7 inHg).</td><td>0.1—0.4 mm (0.004—0.016 in)</td></tr></table>

## ABS model  


1. Inspect the push rod clearance as follows. 
(1) Turn the nut of the SST clockwise to fully retract the SST gauge rod. Attach the SST to the power brake unit.  


## Tightening torque  


9.8- 16 N·m (1.0- 1.6 kgf·m, 7.2- 11 ft·lbf)  


(2) Apply a \(66.7\mathrm{kPa}\) (500 mmHg 19.7 inHg) vacuum by using a vacuum pump.

(3) Turn the adjusting nut of the SST counterclockwise until the gauge rod just contacts the push rod end of the power brake unit. Push lightly on the end of the gauge rod to be sure it is seated. Verify that there is no gap between the adjusting nut and SST body.
