7. Remove the spark plug, high-tension lead and ignition coil. 
8. Connect the SSTs (NGS tester) as shown in the figure.  


## Note  


Using the signal simulation of SST apply a pseudo- pulse to the ignition coil and inspect its operation. Disconnect the ignition coil terminal 1D and 2D from the connectors in advance.
