Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services:<br/>Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel.<br/>Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE" and "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" described in this manual.<br/>01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br/>01-14 AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Inspect following:<br/>Contaminated air cleaner element<br/>Transmission fluid level<br/>Fuel quality<br/>Coolant level<br/>Are all items okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Service as necessary.<br/>Repeat step 1.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Connect NGS tester to DLC-2.<br/>Turn ignition switch to ON.<br/>Retrieve any DTC.<br/>Is "SYSTEM PASSED (NO DTCs AVAILABLE)" displayed?</td><td>Yes No DTC displayed:<br/>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No DTC displayed:<br/>Go to appropriate DTC test.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Connect NGS tester to DLC-2.<br/>Access ECT PID.<br/>Drive vehicle while monitoring PID.<br/>01-40 PID/DATA MONITOR INSPECTION<br/>Is PID within specification?</td><td>Yes No Inspect for coolant leakage, cooling fan and condenser fan operations or thermostat operation.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Is strong blue spark visible at each disconnected high-tension lead while cranking engine?</td><td>Yes Inspect follows:<br/>Spark plugs malfunction<br/>CMP sensor improperly installed<br/>Trigger wheel damage on camshaft<br/>Open or short circuit on CMP sensor<br/>Open or short circuit between CMP sensor and PCM terminal 2H or 3C<br/>Repair or replace malfunctioning part.<br/>If okay, go to next step</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Inspect follows:<br/>High-tension leads<br/>Ignition coil and connector</td></tr></table>
