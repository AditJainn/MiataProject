## GENERATOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


## Warning  


Warning- When the battery cables are connected, touching the vehicle body with generator terminal B will generate sparks. This can cause personal injury, fire, and damage to the electrical components. Always disconnect the battery before performing the following operation.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Remove the intake manifold bracket. 
3. Remove in the order indicated in the table. 
4. Install in the reverse order of removal. 
5. Inspect the drive belt deflection/tension. (Refer to 01-10 DRIVE BELT INSPECTION.)

## GENERATOR INSPECTION  


## Generator Warning Light  


Generator Warning Light1. Verify that the battery is fully charged.2. Verify that the drive belt deflection/tension is correct. (Refer to 01-10 DRIVE BELT INSPECTION.)3. Turn the ignition switch to ON and verify that the generator warning light comes on.4. If not, inspect the generator warning light, wiring harnesses between the battery, generator warning light, and PCM terminal 1Q. When the generator warning light and the wiring harnesses are okay, replace the PCM.5. Verify that the generator warning light goes out after the engine is started.6. If not, verify the diagnostic trouble code No.s displayed. (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION.)  


## Generator  


## Voltage  


GeneratorVoltage1. Verify that the battery is fully charged.2. Verify that the drive belt deflection/tensions within the specification. (Refer to 01-10 DRIVE BELT INSPECTION.)3. Turn off all electrical loads.4. Turn the ignition switch to START and verify that the generator turns smoothly without any noise while the engine is running.5. Measure the voltage at the terminals shown in the table.
