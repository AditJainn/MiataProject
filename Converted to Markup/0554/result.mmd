## REFRIGERANT SYSTEM SERVICE WARNINGS  


Using/Handling Unapproved Refrigerant Using a flammable refrigerant, such as OZ- 12, in this vehicle is dangerous. In an accident, the refrigerant may catch fire, resulting in serious injury or death. When servicing this vehicle, use only R- 134a. Checking for system leaks on a vehicle that has been serviced with flammable refrigerant, such as OZ- 12, is dangerous. Conventional leak detectors use an electronically generated arc which can ignite the refrigerant, causing serious injury or death. If a flammable refrigerant may have been used to service the system, or if you suspect a flammable refrigerant has been used, contact the local fire marshal or EPA office for information on handling the refrigerant.  


## Storing Refrigerant  


The refrigerant container is highly pressurized. If it is subjected to high heat, it could explode, scattering metal fragments and liquid refrigerant that can seriously injure you. Store the refrigerant at temperatures below 40 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) {104 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) }. Do not allow the refrigerant to leak near fire or any kind of heat. A poisonous gas may be generated if the refrigerant gas contacts fire or heat such as from cigarettes and heaters. When carrying out any operation that can cause refrigerant leakage, extinguish or remove the above- mentioned heat sources and maintain adequate ventilation.  


## Handling Refrigerant  


Handling Refrigerant Handling liquid refrigerant is dangerous. A drop of it on the skin can result in localized frostbite. When handling the refrigerant, wear gloves and safety goggles. If refrigerant splashes into the eyes, immediately wash them with clean water and consult a doctor.  


## REFRIGERANT SYSTEM SERVICE CAUTIONS  


## Compressor Oil  


Use only DENSO OIL9 compressor oil for this vehicle. Using PAG oil other than DENSO OIL9 compressor oil can damage the A/C compressor. Do not spill DENSO OIL9 compressor oil on the vehicle. A drop of compressor oil on the vehicle surface can eat away at the paint. If oil gets on the vehicle, wipe it off immediately. PAG oil has a higher moisture absorption efficiency than the previously used mineral oil. If moisture mixes with the compressor oil, the refrigerant system could be damaged. Therefore, install caps immediately after using the compressor oil or removing refrigerant system parts to prevent moisture absorption.
