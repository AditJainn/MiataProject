2. Use a clean rag to wipe off the mounting surface on the oil filter body. 
3. Apply clean engine oil to the O-ring of the oil filter. 
4. Tighten the filter according to the installation direction on the side of it or packing box by using the SST. 
5. Start the engine and inspect for oil leakage. 
6. Inspect the oil level and add oil as necessary. (Refer to 01-11 ENGINE OIL LEVEL INSPECTION.)  


## OIL PRESSURE INSPECTION  


X5U111W04  


## Warning  


Continuous exposure with USED engine oil has caused skin cancer in laboratory mice. Protect your skin by washing with soap and water immediately after this work. When the engine and the oil are hot, they can badly burn. Turn off the engine and wait until they are cool.  


1. Remove the oil pressure switch. 
2. Screw the SST into the oil pressure switch installation hole.

3. Warm up the engine to normal operating temperature.  


4. Run the engine at the specified speed, and note the gauge readings.  


## Note  


The oil pressure can vary with oil viscosity and temperature.  


## Oil pressure  


295- 392 kPa {3.0- 4.0 kgf/cm², 43- 56 psi} {3,000 rpm}  


5. If the pressure is not as specified, inspect for amount of engine oil, oil leakage, or any wear parts inside of engine etc. Repair or replace as necessary.  


6. Stop the engine and wait until it is cool.  


7. Remove the SST.

8. Apply silicone sealant to the oil pressure switch threads as shown. 
9. Install the oil pressure switch.  


## Tightening torque  


12- 17 N·m {1.2- 1.8 kgf·m, 9- 13 ft·lbf}  


10. Start the engine and inspect for oil leakage.
