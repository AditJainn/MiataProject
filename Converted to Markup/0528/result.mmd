## AIR BLEEDING  


1. Inspect the fluid level. 
2. Turn the steering wheel fully to the left and right several times with the engine not running. 
3. Inspect the fluid level. If it has dropped, add fluid. 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the fluid level stabilizes.  


5. Start the engine and let it idle. 
6. Turn the steering wheel fully to the left and right several times. 
7. Verify that the fluid is not foamy and that the fluid level has not dropped. 
8. Add fluid as necessary, and repeat steps 6 and 7.
