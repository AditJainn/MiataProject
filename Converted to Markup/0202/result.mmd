3. Install the pulley boss and pulley lock bolt. 
4. Turn the crankshaft clockwise 1 and 5/6 times, and align the timing belt pulley mark with the tensioner set mark for proper timing belt tension adjustment.

6. Verify that the timing belt pulley mark is aligned with the tensioner set mark.  


## Caution  


Be sure not to apply tension other than that of the tensioner spring.  


7. Loosen the tensioner lock bolt to apply tension to the timing belt.  


## Caution  


Avoid the tensioner from moving with the tensioner lock bolt as it is turned.  


8. Tighten the tensioner lock bolt.  


## Tightening torque  


38- 51 N·m {3.8- 5.3 kgf·m, 28- 38 ft·lbf}  


9. Install the pulley boss and the pulley lock bolt. 
10. Turn the crankshaft 2 and 1/6 times, and face the pin on the pulley boss straight up.  


11. Verify that the camshaft pulley marks are aligned with the timing marks as shown.

12. If not, repeat from Timing Belt Removal Note. (Refer to Timing Belt Removal Note.)  


13. Inspect the timing belt deflection at the point indicated by applying moderate pressure 98 N {10 kgf, 22 lbf}.  


Timing belt deflection 8.5- 11.5 mm {0.35- 0.45 in}
