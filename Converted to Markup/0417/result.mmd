## FRONT ABS WHEEL-SPEED SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Clearance Inspection  


1. Remove the wheel and tire, and inspect the sensor for looseness and damage. Replace the sensor as necessary. 
2. Verify the clearance between the ABS wheel-speed sensor and the sensor rotor.

## Voltage Inspection  


1. On level ground, jack up the vehicle and support it evenly on safety stands. 
2. Disconnect the ABS wheel-speed sensor connector. 
3. Inspect each wheel by rotating it at one revolution per second.  


## Voltage 0.25-1.2 V (AC)  


4. If not as specified, replace the ABS wheel-speed sensor or sensor rotor as necessary.  


## Clearance  


0.3- 1.1 mm (0.012- 0.043 in)  


3. If not as specified, replace the ABS wheel-speed sensor or sensor rotor as necessary.  

# Resistance Inspection  


1. Disconnect the ABS wheel-speed sensor connector. 
2. Inspect for resistance at the ABS wheel-speed sensor.
