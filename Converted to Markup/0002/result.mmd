## Repair procedure  


1. Most repair operations begin with an overview illustration. It identifies the components, shows how the parts fit together, and describes visual part inspection. However, only removal/installation procedures which need to be performed methodically have written instructions.  


2. Expendable parts, tightening torques, and symbols for oil, grease, and sealant are shown in the overview illustration. In addition, symbols indicating parts which require the use of special service tools are for removal/installation also shown.  


3. The procedures steps are numbered and the part that is the main point of that procedure is shown in the illustration with the corresponding number. Occasionally, there are important points or information concerning a procedure. Refer to this information when servicing the related part.
