## Stall Test  


1. Perform mechanical system test preparation. (Refer to Mechanical System Test Preparation.) 
2. Shift the selector lever to R position.  


## Caution  


If the accelerator pedal is pressed for longer than 5 seconds while the brake pedal is pressed, the transmission could be damaged. Therefore, perform both steps 3 and 4 within 5 seconds.  


3. Firmly depress the brake pedal with the left foot, and gently depress the accelerator pedal with the right. 
4. When the engine speed no longer increases, quickly read the speed and release the accelerator pedal. 
5. Shift the selector to N position and let the engine idle for 1 minute or more to cool the ATF. 
6. Perform a stall test of D, 2, and 1 ranges in the same manner.  


Engine stall speed 2,370- 2,740 rpm

## Time Lag Test  


1. Perform mechanical system test preparation. (Refer to Mechanical System Test Preparation.)  


2. Shift the selector from N position to D range. (O/D OFF switch OFF)  


3. Use a stopwatch to measure the time it takes from shifting until shock is felt. Make three measurements for each test and take the average from the results.  


4. Perform the test for the following shifts in the same manner.  


(1) N position \(\rightarrow\) D range (O/D OFF SW ON) 
(2) N position \(\rightarrow\) R position  


Time lag N position \(\rightarrow\) D range: 0.7 sec N position \(\rightarrow\) R position: 1.2 sec
