## Short circuit  


EGR valve connector terminal E and PCM connector terminal 2M to ground EGR valve connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 2N to ground EGR valve connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 2O to ground EGR valve connector terminal F and PCM connector terminal 2P to ground  


4. Remove the EGR valve, and inspect for any damage or clogging. Replace the EGR valve if not as specified. 
5. Connect the negative battery cable.  


## EGR BOOST SENSOR SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "EGR Control Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, EGR Control Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the EGR boost sensor solenoid valve.  


## Airflow Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Remove the EGR boost sensor solenoid valve. 
3. Inspect airflow between each port under the following conditions.  


4. If not as specified, replace the EGR boost sensor solenoid valve. If as specified but the Simulation Test is failed, inspect following: Vacuum hose improper routing, kinks or leakage.
