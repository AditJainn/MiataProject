## INPUT/TURBINE SPEED SENSOR INSPECTION  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Removal the bracket and front pipe. (Refer to 01-15 EXHAUST SYSTEM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
3. Disconnect the input/turbine speed sensor connector.  


## Note  


Resistance value input/turbine speed sensor varies with temperature. Normal resistance value occurs when the temperature is \(20^{\circ}C\) (68 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ), but it may be abnormal at high temperatures. Therefore, do not determine the resistance value only at \(20^{\circ}C\) (68 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ).  


4. Measure the resistance between the terminals of the input/turbine speed sensor.  


Resistance 560- 680 \(\Omega\) (20 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) (68 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ))

5. If not correct, replace the input/turbine speed sensor. 
6. Connect the input/turbine speed sensor connector. 
7. Install the front pipe and bracket. (Refer to 01-15 EXHAUST SYSTEM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION. 
8. Connect the negative battery cable.
