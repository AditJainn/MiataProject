4. Install the ring gear onto the gear case.  


Tightening torque 69- 83 N.m {7.0- 8.5 kgf.m, 51- 61 ft-lbf}  


5. Press the bearing inner races (side bearing) on by using the SST.

6. Install the differential gear component in the carrier.  


7. Note the identification marks on the adjusting nuts, and install them on their respective sides.  


8. Install the differential bearing caps, making sure that the identification mark on the cap corresponds with the one on the carrier, by using the SST. Then temporarily tighten the bolts.

(1) Mark the ring gear at four points at approx. 90° intervals. Mount a dial indicator to the carrier so that the feeler comes in contact at a right angle with one of the ring gear teeth. 
(2) Turn both bearing adjusters equally by using the SST until the backlash is 0.09-0.11 mm {0.0035-0.0043 in}. 
(3) Inspect for the backlash at the three other marked points, and make sure the maximum backlash is less than 0.07 mm {0.0028 in}.

9. Tighten or loosen the adjusting nuts equally until the distance between the pilot sections on the bearing caps is 185.428-185.50 mm {7.3003-7.3031 in}.  


10. Reinspect for the backlash.

11. Inspect the teeth contact as follows.  


(1) Coat both surfaces of 6-8 teeth of the ring gear with a thin coat of red lead. 
(2) While moving the ring gear back and forth by hand, rotate the drive pinion several times and inspect the tooth contact. 
(3) If the tooth contact is good, wipe off the red lead. 
(4) If it is not good, adjust the pinion height, and then adjust the backlash.

① Inspect the toe and flank contact by replacing the spacer with a thinner one to move the drive pinion outward. 
② Inspect the heel and face contact by replacing the spacer with a thicker one to bring the drive pinion in.
