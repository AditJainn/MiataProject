(2) If there is a difference of \(0.5 \mathrm{~V}\) or more, inspect the following points concerning the PCM connector: 
- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discoloration (blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


2. When you get an unusual signal, measure the #2 sensor terminal voltage.  


(1) If there is a \(0.5 \mathrm{~V}\) or more difference between the sensor and NGS voltages, inspect the harness for open or short circuits.  


(2) If the sensor and NGS voltages are the same, inspect the following points concerning the sensor connector. If there are no problems, proceed to next investigation below.  


- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discoloration 
(blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


## Investigate the electrical supply system  


1. Confirm that the sensor #3 terminal is B+.  


(1) If the measured voltage on the #3 terminal is B+, inspect the following points on the sensor connector. If there is no problem, proceed to next investigation below. 
- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discolouration (blackness) 
(2) If the #3 terminal measures other than B+, inspect the following points: 
- Open or short circuit in harness 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


## Investigate the GND system  


1. Confirm that terminal sensor #4 is at 0 V. 
(1) If it is at 0 V, inspect the sensor. If necessary, replace the sensor. 
(2) If not at, 0 V, inspect the following points: 
- Open circuit in harness 
- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discoluration (blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is lose or disconnected  


## Thermistor Type (Intake Air Temperature and Engine Coolant Temperature Sensors)  


## Investigate the input signal system  


1. When you get an unusual signal, measure the #1 PCM terminal voltage.  


(1) If the #1 terminal voltage and the NGS monitor voltage are the same, proceed to the next step.  


(2) If there is a difference of \(0.5 \mathrm{~}V\) or more, check the following points concerning the PCM connector:  


- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- PIN discoloration (blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


2. When you get an unusual signal, measure the #2 sensor terminal voltage  


(1) If there is a \(0.5 \mathrm{~V}\) Or more difference between the sensor and NGS voltages, inspect the harness for open or short circuits. 
(2) If the sensor and NGS voltages are the same, inspect the following points concerning  


(2) If the sensor and NGS voltages are the same, inspect the follwing points concerning the sensor connector. If there are no problems, proceed to next investigation below.  

- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discoloration blackness 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected  


## Investigate the GND system  


1. Confirm that terminal sensor #3 is at 0 V. 
(1) If it is at 0 V, inspect. the sensor. If necessary, replace the sensor. 
(2) If not, inspect the following points: 
- Open or short circuit in harness 
- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
-Pin discoloration (blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected

Engine Coolant Temperature Sensors)  


1. Measure the #1 PCM terminal voltage and confirm that it is at 0 V or 5 V when the ignition switch is at ON and the engine at idle. 
(1) If it is at 0 V or 5 V, proceed to "Intermittent Diagnostic Test". 
(2) If not, inspect the following points concerning the PCM connector. If there is no problems, proceed to next step. 
- Female terminal opening loose 
- Coupler (pin holder) damage 
- Pin discoloraton (blackness) 
- Harness/pin clamp is loose or disconnected
