## Cooling fan  


1. Verify the engine is cold.  


2. Turn the ignition switch to ON.  


3. Verify the cooling fan is not operating.  


4. If the cooling fan is operating:  


(1) Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2. 
(2) Select the "SIMULATION TEST". Then, select "FAN2" in "IG ON TEST". 
(3) Send verify "OFF" and the cooling fan is OFF. 
(4) If the cooling fan is ON inspect: 
- Cooling fan relay stuck in closed position. 
- Short to ground circuit between cooling fan relay and PCM terminal R. 
- Short to power in circuit between cooling fan relay. 
- DTCs for ECT sensor. 
- P0117, P0118, P0125  


(5) If the cooling fan is OFF, inspect the following.  


- Short to ground circuit between A/C switch and PCM terminal P. 
- DTC for ECT sensor. 
- P0117, P0118, P0125  

5. Start the engine. 
6. Verify that the cooling fan is operating when engine is hot. 
7. If the cooling fan does not operate, do as follows. 
(1) Connect the SSTs (NGS tester) to the DLC-2. 
(2) Select "SIMULATION TEST" mode. 
(3) Select "IG ON TEST" mode. 
(4) Select "FAN2". 
(5) Press "Start". 
(6) If the cooling fan operates, inspect the ECT sensor DTCs. 
- P0117, P0118, P0125  


5. Start the engine.  


6. Verify that the cooling fan is operating when engine is hot.  


7. If the cooling fan does not operate, do as follows.  


(1) Connect the SSTs (NGS tester) to the DLC-2. (2) Select "SIMULATION TEST" mode. 
(3) Select "IG ON TEST mode. 
(4) Select "FAN2". 
(5) Press "Start" 
(6) If the cooling fan operates, inspect the ECT sensor DTCs.  


(7) If the cooling fan does not operate, do as follows.  


\(①\) Select "FAN2". Operate cooling fan by selecting "Start", and verify that operation sound is heard from the cooling fan relay. \(②\) If the operation sound is heard, inspect the wiring harnesses and connectors and cooling fan motor. \(③\) If operational sound is heard, inspect cooling fan relay and open circuit in wiring harnesses and connectors.  


8. Turn the A/C switch and fan switch on.  


9. Verify the cooling fan is operating.  


10. If fan does not operate, inspect A/C system.  


## Condenser fan relay  


1. Verify that A/C switch and fan switch are off.  


2. Start the engine and let it idle.  


3. Verify that the condenser fan is not operating.  


4. If condenser fan is operating, inspect:  


Condenser fan relay for stuck in closed position Short to power in circuit between condenser fan relay and condenser fan Short to ground in circuit between A/C pressure switch and PCM terminal 1P Short to ground circuit between condenser fan relay and PCM terminal I (short circuit)  


5. Turn the A/C switch and fan switch on. 
6. Verify that the condenser fan is operating and operating sound of A/C compressor magnetic clutch is heard.  


7. Turn the A/C switch and fan switch off.  


8. If the condenser fan does not operate but operating sound of A/C compressor magnetic clutch is heard, inspect as follows:  


Open circuit between ignition switch and condenser fan relay Open circuit between battery and condenser fan relay Open circuit between condenser fan relay and PCM terminal 11 Open circuit between condenser fan relay and condenser fan motor or fan motor ground Condenser fan relay stuck open Condenser fan motor  


9. If both condenser fan and A/C compressor do not operate, inspect:  


- TP V PID 
- A/C system
