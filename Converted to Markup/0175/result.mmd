## Note  


Note- Verify that a click is heard when the SST is pushed into the pulsation damper No.1.

4. Pull the connector by hand and verify that it is installed securely. Visually inspect that the tabs of the retainer are securely fitted into the connector. 
5. Connect the negative battery cable. 
6. Verify that vehicles for AT is at N range and MT is at neutral position, then start the engine. 
7. Observe the fuel pressure gauge indicator while heavy acceleration. 
8. Verify that the fuel pressure holds steady within specification during the test.  


## Fuel hold pressure  


\(370 - 420 \text{kPa} (3.7 - 4.3 \text{kgf/cm}^2, 53 - 61 \text{psi})\)  


9. Disconnect the SST and connect the fuel pipe to the pulsation damper No.1. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, Fuel Pipe Installation Note.) 
10. If not as specified, refer to 01-14 PRESSURE REGULATOR INSPECTION, Fuel Hold Pressure Inspection.  


## Fuel Pump Operation Inspection  


1. Connect the NGS tester to the DLC-2.

2. Remove the fuel filler cap.  


3. Turn the ignition switch to ON.  


4. Select the "SIMULATION TEST" function on the NGS display. Turn the fuel pump relay from OFF to ON by using the "F/P RLY" and inspect if the operation sound is heard.  


5. If no operation sound is heard, measure the voltage at harness side fuel pump connector terminal B.

2. Turn the ignition switch to ON.  


3. Select "SIMULATION TEST" and press TRIGGER.  


4. Select "IG ON TEST" and press TRIGGER.  


5. Select "FP RLY" and press TRIGGER.  


6. Press START.  


7. Turn the fuel pump relay from off to on and inspect if operation sound of the fuel pump relay is heard.  


8. If the operation sound is not heard, inspect the fuel pump relay.  


9. If the fuel pump relay is normal, inspect the following.
