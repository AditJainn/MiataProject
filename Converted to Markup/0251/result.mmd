## FUEL PUMP RELAY INSPECTION  


## Note  


Note- The lock of the fuel pump relay will be easily broken when removing the relay from the bracket. Do not remove the relay from the bracket except when replacement is required. Perform "FUEL PUMP RELAY INSPECTION" before removing the relay.  


## Simulation Test  


Simulation Test1. Carry out the "Fuel Pump Operation Inspection", "Fuel Pump Control Inspection". (Refer to 01- 01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel Pump Operation Inspection.) (Refer to 01- 01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel Pump Control Inspection.)2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the fuel pump relay.  


## Continuity Inspection  


## Note  


Note- Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Disconnect the fuel pump relay connector (6-pin type connector: 4 terminal) located above the accelerator pedal.
