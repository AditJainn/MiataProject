## REFRIGERANT SYSTEM GENERAL PROCEDURES  


## Manifold Gauge Set Installation  


1. Fully close the valves of the manifold gauge.  
2. Connect charging hoses to the high- and low-pressure side joints of the manifold gauge.  
3. Connect quick couplers to the ends of the charging hoses.  
4. Remove the caps from the high- and low-pressure side charging valves.  
5. Connect the quick couplers to the charging valves.  


## REFRIGERANT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE TEST  


## Note  


After servicing the refrigerant system, test its performance.  


1. Install the manifold gauge set. (Refer to 07-10 REFRIGERANT SYSTEM GENERAL PROCEDURES, Manifold Gauge Set Installation.)  
2. Open the hood.  
3. Close all the doors and all the windows.  
4. Warm up the engine and run it at a constant 1,500 rpm.  
5. Turn the A/C switch on.  
6. Set the fan switch at 4th.  
7. Set the REC/FRESH lever to REC.  
8. Set the mode lever to VENT.  
9. Set the temperature control lever to MAX COLD.

10. Measure the center ventilator temperature and record the temperature reading.  
11. Measure the ambient temperature and record the temperature reading.  
12. Verify that the temperature reading is in the shaded zone (maximum \(6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) (43 \(^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\) )).  
13. If the performance is not within the shaded zone, troubleshoot the refrigerant system. (Refer to 07-01 TROUBLESHOOTING.)  


## REFRIGERANT CHARGE CHECK  


1. Install the manifold gauge set. (Refer to 07-10 REFIGERANT SYSTEM GENERAL PROCEDURES, Manifold Gauge Set Installation.)  
2. Check the refrigerant pressure reading with the engine stopped.  
3. Verify that the high- and low-pressure side readings of the manifold gauge are at 493-788 kPa (5.02-8.04 kgf/cm², 72-114 psi). If the pressure readings are lower than specified, recharge the refrigerant amount. (Refer to 07-10 REFRIGERANT CHARGING.) If the pressure readings are within the specification but there is insufficient cooling, go to the next step. If the pressure readings are within the specification and there are no leaks, the refrigerant amount is OK.  
4. Start the engine and run it at a constant 2000 rpm.  
5. Turn the A/C switch on and set the fan switch at 4th.  
6. Set the REC/FRESH lever to REC.  


7. If the A/C compressor is short-cycling, note the low-pressure side reading at which the magnetic clutch kicks out.  
8. If the pressure is 170 kPa (1.7 kgf/cm², 24 psi) or lower, evacuate then recharge the refrigerant system with the proper amount of refrigerant. (Refer to 07-10 REFRIGERANT CHARGING.) If the pressur is 210 kPa (2.1 kgf/cm², 30 psi) or higher, inspect the thermoswitch. (Refer to 07-40 THERMOSWITCH INSPECTION.)
