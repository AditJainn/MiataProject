5. If the rod operation is not as specified, do as follows.  


(1) Stop the engine.  


(2) Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2. (Refer to 01-40 POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) INSPECTION.)  


(3) Verify that diagnostic trouble code No. P1523 is not displayed. If code No. P1523 is shown, carry out troubleshooting of the code No. P1523. (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE ON-BOARD DIAGNOSIS [BP], Diagnostic Trouble Code Inspection.)  


(4) If diagnostic trouble codes are not shown, do as follows.  


\(①\) Start the engine and run it at idle. \(②\) Select the SIMULATION TEST function on the NGS display.

\(③\) Turn the VICS solenoid valve from on to off by using the "VICS V" and inspect if operation sound of the solenoid valve is heard. \(④\) If the operation sound is heard, inspect the following. Shutter valve actuator (Refer to 01- 13 SHUTTER VALVE ACTUATOR INSPECTION [BP].) \(⑤\) If the operation sound is not heard, inspect the following. VICS solenoid valve (Refer to 01- 13 VICS SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION [BP].)  


## Note  


The shutter valve actuator rod extends for five seconds after the engine is started.  


## Fuel Line Pressure Inspection  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


1. Complete the "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE". (Refer to 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


3. Disconnect the fuel pipe on the pulsation damper No.1 outlet side. Set the SST between the pulsation damper No.1 and fuel distributor as shown in the figure. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, Fuel Pipe Removal Note.)  


## Note  


Verify that a click is heard when the SST is pushed into the pulsation damper No.1

4. Pull the connector by hand and verify that it is installed securely. Visually inspect that the tabs of the retainer are securely fitted into the connector. 
5. Connect the negative battery cable. 
6. Start the engine and let it idle. Measure the fuel line pressure.  


## Fuel line pressure  


370- 420 kPa (3.7- 4.3 kgf/cm², 53- 61 psi)  


7. If not as specified, refer to 01-14 PRESSURE REGULATOR INSPECTION, Fuel Line Pressure Inspection.  


8. Disconnect the SST and connect the fuel pipe to the pulsation damper No.1. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATON, Fuel Pipe Installation Note.)  


9. Complete the "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" (Refer to FUEL SYSTEM, AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE.)  


## Fuel Hold Pressure Inspection  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or Death and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


1. Complete the "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE". (Refer to 0l-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
3. Disconnect the fuel pipe on the pulsation damper No.1 outlet side. Se the SST between the pulsation damper No.1 and fuel distributor as shown in the figure.(Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, FuEl Pipe Removal Note.)
