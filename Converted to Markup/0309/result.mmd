## NEUTRAL SWITCH INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Continuity  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


2. Remove the neutral switch.  


3. Inspect for continuity between the neutral switch terminals by using an ohmmeter.

## POWER STEERING PRESSURE SWITCH INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Continuity  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Inspect as follows if power steering is inoperative: (Refer to 06-12.)  


2. Disconnect the PSP switch connector. 
3. Start the engine.  


4. Inspect for continuity between PSP switch  


terminal and a ground by using an ohmmeter.

4. if not as specified, replace the neutral switch. If neutral switch is okay but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Power circuit (Neutral switch connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 1V through common connector.) Ground circuit (Neutral switch connector terminal B and ground through common connector.)  


## Short circuit  


Neutral switch connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 1V through common connector to ground.  


5. Reconnect the neutral switch connector.

5. If not as specified, replace the PSP switch. If PSP switch is okay but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Power circuit (PSP switch connector terminal and PCM connector terminal 1G through common connector.) Ground circuit (PSP switch ground circuit.)  


## Short circuit  


PSP switch connector terminal and PCM connector terminal 1G through common connector to ground.  


6. Reconnect the PSP switch connector.
