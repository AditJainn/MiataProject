## Caution  


Performing the following procedures without first removing the ABS wheel- speed sensor may possibly cause an open circuit in the harness if it is pulled by mistake. Before performing the following procedures, remove the ABS wheel- speed sensor (axle side) and fix it to an appropriate place where the sensor will not be pulled by mistake while servicing the vehicle.  


1. Remove in the order indicated in the table. 
2. With the wheels in the straight-ahead position, install in the reverse order of removal. 
3. After installation, inspect the total toe-in and adjust it as necessary.
