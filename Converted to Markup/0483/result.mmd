## ATF Level Inspection  


## Caution  


Caution- The ATF amount varies according to ATF's temperature. Therefore, when checking the ATF level or replacing the ATF, use a thermometer to measure the temperature then adjust the ATF amount to the specified level according to the specified temperature.  


1. Park the vehicle on level ground. 
2. Apply the parking brake and position wheel chocks securely to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 
3. Adjust the length or thermistor probe measure the same as the dipstick and hold the probe with a paper holder. Insert into the filler tube and measure the temperature.  


4. Inspect the ATF level before warming up the engine. In this case, use the cool range (15-25 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) (59-77 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ). 
5. Warm up the engine until the ATF reaches 60-70 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) (140-158 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ). 
6. While depressing the brake pedal, shift the selector lever to each range (P-1), pausing momentarily in each range. 
7. Shift back to P position. 
8. While the engine is idling, verify that the ATF level is in the HOT 65 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) (149 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ) range. Adjust ATF level to the specification, if necessary.  


ATF type M- III or equivalent (e.g. Dexron®II)

## AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID (ATF) REPLACEMENT  


## Warning  


Warning- When the transmission and ATF are hot, they can badly burn you. Turn off the engine and wait until they are cool before changing the ATF.  


1. Remove the dipstick. 
2. Remove the drain plug and washer. 
3. Drain the ATF into a container. 
4. Install a new washer and the drain plug.  


Tightening torque 18- 22 N·m {1.8- 2.3 kgf·m, 14- 16 in·lbf}  


5. Add the specified amount and type of ATF through the oil filler tube.  


ATF type M- III or equivalent (e.g. Dexron®II). Fill amount 6.7 L {7.1 US qt, 5.9 Imp qt}  


6. Install the dipstick. 
7. Ensure that the ATF level is in the HOT 65 \(^\circ \mathrm{C}\) (49 \(^\circ \mathrm{F}\) ) range. 
8. Add ATF to the specified level if necessary.
