## Voltage 4.5-5.5 V  


4. Reconnect the connector. 
5. Disconnect the vacuum hose from the EGR boost sensor. Connect the vacuum pump to the EGR boost sensor. 
6. Select BARO V PID on the NGS tester and press START. 
7. Apply the vacuum and verify that the BARO V is as specified on the table.  


## Vref Terminal Circuit Inspection  


1. Turn the ignition switch to ON. 
2. Measure the voltage between the throttle position sensor connector (vehicle side) terminal A and body ground by using a voltmeter. 
(1) Measurement voltage is 0 V. 
① Turn the ignition switch off. 
② Disconnect the throttle position sensor connector, EGR boost sensor connector, and fuel tank pressure sensor connector (which is applied Vref). 
③ Verify there is no continuity between the throttle position sensor connector (vehicle side) terminal A and body ground by using an ohmmeter.

\(④\) If there is continuity, repair the related harness for short to circuit. \(⑤\) Inspect continuity between the PCM connector (vehicle side) terminal 2l and each sensor connector (vehicle side) terminals which is applied Vref by using an ohmmeter.

\(⑥\) If there is continuity, repair the related harnesses.  


(2) Measurement voltage is \(\mathsf{B}+\)  


\(①\) Turn the ignition switch off.  


\(②\) Disconnect the battery positive harness and battery negative harness.  


\(③\) Verify there is no continuity between the throttle position sensor connector (vehicle side) terminal A and battery positive harness by using an ohmmeter.

\(④\) If there is continuity, repair the related harnesses for short to \(\mathsf{B}+\) circuit.  


(3) Measurement voltage is approx. 5 V. Vref terminal of PCM is okay.  


## Ground Circuit Inspection  


1. Turn the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect the PCM connectors. 
3. Inspect for continuity between the PCM ground terminals and body ground by using an ohmmeter.
