## PURGE SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "Purge Control Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Purge Control Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the purge solenoid valve.  


## Airflow Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Remove the purge solenoid valve. (Refer to 01-16 PURGE SOLENOID VALVE REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.)  


2. Inspect airflow between the ports under the following conditions.  



O:Continuity O:Airflow

## EVAPORATIVE CHAMBER INSPECTION  


1. Remove the evaporative chamber. 
2. Blow from port A and verify that there is airflow from port B.  


3. If not as specified, replace the evaporative chamber.
