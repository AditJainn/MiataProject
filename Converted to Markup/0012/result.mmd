## Torque Formulas  


Torque Formulas- When using a torque wrench- SST combination, the written torque must be recalculated due to the extra length that the SST adds to the torque wrench. Recalculate the torque by using the following formulas. Choose the formula that applies to you.  



<table><tr><td>Torque Unit</td><td>Formula</td></tr><tr><td>N·m</td><td>N·m × [L/(L+A)]</td></tr><tr><td>kgf·m</td><td>kgf·m × [L/(L+A)]</td></tr><tr><td>kgf·cm</td><td>kgf·cm × [L/(L+A)]</td></tr><tr><td>ft·lbf</td><td>ft·lbf × [L/(L+A)]</td></tr><tr><td>in·lbf</td><td>in·lbf × [L/(L+A)]</td></tr></table>


A : The length of the SST past the torque wrench drive. L : The length of the torque wrench.  


## Vise  


Vise- When using a vise, put protective plates in the jaws of the vise to prevent damage to parts.

## Dynamometer  


Dynamometer- When test- running a vehicle on a dynamometer:  - Place a fan, preferably a vehicle- speed proportional type, in front of the vehicle.  - Connect an exhaust gas ventilation unit.  - Cool the exhaust pipes with a fan.  - Keep the area around the vehicle uncluttered.  - Watch the water temperature gauge.  


## Note  


Note- When the vehicle is on a chassis roller and only the front wheels rotate, the ABS warning light may illuminate. Refer to 04- 01 PRECAUTION to turn off the warning light.  


## INSTALLATION OF RADIO SYSTEM  


If a radio system is installed improperly or if a high- powered type is used, the CIS and other systems may be affected. When the vehicle is to be equipped with a radio, observe the following precautions:  


1. Install the antenna at the farthest point from control modules.  


2. Install the antenna feeder as far as possible from the control module harnesses. 
3. Ensure that the antenna and feeder are properly adjusted. 
4. Do not install a high-powered radio system.
