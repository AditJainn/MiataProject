## PRECAUTION (BRAKES)  


Wheels and tires removal/installation  


The removal and installation procedures for the wheels and tires are not mentioned in this section. When a wheel is removed, tighten it to 89- 117 N·m (9.0- 12.0 kgf·m, 66- 86 ft·lbf).  


## Brake lines disconnection/connection  


## Caution  


Brake fluid will damage painted surfaces. If brake fluid does get on a painted surface, wipe it off immediately.  


Tighten the brake pipe flare nut by using the SST (49 0259 770B). Be sure to modify the brake pipe flare nut tightening torque to allow for use of a torque wrench- SST combination. (Refer to 00- 00 FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURES, Torque Formulas.)  


If any brake line has been disconnected anytime during the procedure, add brake fluid, bleed the brakes, and inspect for leakage after the procedure has been completed.  


## Connectors disconnection  


Disconnect the negative battery cable before doing any work that requires handling of connectors. Reconnect the negative battery cable only after the work is completed.  


## ABS components operations  


Make sure that there are no diagnostic trouble codes in the ABS memory after working on ABS components. If there are any codes in the memory, erase them.
