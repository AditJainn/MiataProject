## FUEL PUMP INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "Fuel Pump Operation Inspection", "Fuel Pump Control Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel Pump Operation Inspection.) (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel Pump Control Inspection.)  


2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the fuel pump.  


## Continuity Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


2. Remove the service hole cover.  


3. Disconnect the fuel pump connector.  


4. Inspect for continuity between fuel pump connector terminals B and D.

5. If there is no continuity, replace the fuel pump. If as specified but the Simulation Test is failed, inspect following:  


Fuel pump relay malfunction  


## Open circuit  


Ground circuit (Fuel pump connector terminal D and body ground) Power circuit (Fuel pump relay connector terminal C and fuel pump connector terminal B through common connector)

## Short circuit  


Fuel pump relay connector terminal C and fuel pump connector terminal B through common connector to ground.  


6. Reconnect the fuel pump connector.  


## Fuel Pump Maximum Pressure Inspection  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


1. Complete the "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE". (Refer to 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
3. Lift up the vehicle with safety stands. 
4. Remove the fuel filter cover. 
5. Inspect that the quick release connector joint area is free of foreign materials. Clean as necessary. 
6. Set the SST to the fuel filter outlet pipe and push into the quick release connector and disconnect the fuel pipe.

FUEL FILTER OUTLET PIPE  


XSU114WB2  


## Caution  


Caution- Removing the retainer from the disconnected fuel pipe will reduce the effectiveness of the retainer. The retainer must be replaced when any of the following applies.1. Scratches or damage is observed on the retainer.2. Fuel pipe has been replaced.3. Fuel filter (high-pressure) has been replaced.  


7. If removal of the retainer is required, remove it by squeezing the tabs of the retainer. 
8. Cover the disconnected quick release connector to prevent them from being scratched or contaminated with foreign materials. 
9. Turn the lever as shown to plug the SST outlet. Push the SST into the fuel filter outlet pipe until a click is heard. 
10. Connect a fuel hose and clamp to the SST outlet pipe. Set the fuel hose into a container to avoid fuel spills.
