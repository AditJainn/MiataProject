## THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Note  


Note- The throttle position sensor on this type of vehicle is a maintenance- free type.- Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. If not as PID value specified, inspect as follows:  


Verify that the throttle valve is fully closed. Accelerator cable the free play (Refer to 01- 13. ) Throttle cable the free play (Refer to 01- 13. ) Actuator cable the free play (Refer to 01- 20. )  


2. If above specified okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Open circuit- Reference voltage circuit (Throttle position sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 21. )- Throttle position circuit (Throttle position sensor connector terminal C and PCM connector terminal 3E. )- Ground circuit (Throttle position sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3F. )

## Short circuit  


Short circuit- Throttle position sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 21 to ground.- Throttle position sensor connector terminal C and PCM connector terminal 3E to ground.  


3. Reconnect the throttle position sensor connector. 
4. If correct the above open or short circuit, replace throttle position sensor.  


## THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR REPLACEMENT  


THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR REPLACEMENT1. Disconnect the throttle position sensor connector.2. Remove the attaching screws.3. Remove the throttle position sensor.4. Verify that the throttle valve is fully closed.5. Catch the tang of the throttle body on the throttle position sensor plastic rotor.6. Position the throttle position sensor on the throttle body so that the mounting holes align.7. Install the attaching screws.  


8. Release the throttle. 
9. Verify the throttle position sensor PID value. (Refer to 01-40 PID/DATA MONITOR INSPECTION) 
10. If not as PID value specified, carry out the THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR INSPECTION. If not as PID (TP V) condition, replace the throttle body.
