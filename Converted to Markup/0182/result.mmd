## Spark Test  


Spark Test1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.2. Disconnect the fuel pump relay connector.3. Verify that each high- tension lead and connector is connected properly.4. Inspect the ignition system in the following procedure.  


## Warning  


Warning- High voltage in the ignition system can cause strong electrical shock which can result in serious injury. Avoid direct contact to the vehicle body during the following spark test.
