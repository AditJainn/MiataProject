## VALVE CLEARANCE INSPECTION  


1. Remove the cylinder head cover. 
2. Verify that the engine is in cold condition. 
3. Measure the valve clearance.  


(1) Turn the crankshaft clockwise so that the No.1 piston is at TDC of the compression stroke.

(2) Measure the valve clearance at A in the figure.  


Standard [Engine cold] IN: \(0.18 - 0.24 \text{mm} \{0.008 - 0.009 \text{in}\}\) \((0.21 \pm 0.03 \text{mm} \{0.008 \pm 0.0012 \text{in}\})\) EX: \(0.28 - 0.34 \text{mm} \{0.012 - 0.013 \text{in}\}\) \((0.31 \pm 0.03 \text{mm} \{0.012 \pm 0.0012 \text{in}\})\)

(3) If the valve clearance exceeds the standard, replace the adjustment shim. (Refer to 01-10 VALVE CLEARANCE ADJUSTMENT.) 
(4) Turn the crankshaft 360° clockwise so that the No.4 piston is at TDC of the compression stroke. 
(5) Measure the valve clearance at B in the figure.  


Standard [Engine cold] IN: \(0.18 - 0.24\text{mm} \{0.008 - 0.009\text{in}\}\) \((0.21\pm 0.03\text{mm} \{0.008\pm 0.0012\text{in}\})\) EX: \(0.28 - 0.34\text{mm} \{0.012 - 0.013\text{in}\}\) \((0.31\pm 0.03\text{mm} \{0.012\pm 0.0012\text{in}\})\)  


(6) If the valve clearance exceeds the standard, replace the adjustment shim. (Refer to 0110 VALVE CLEARANCE ADJUSTMENT.) 
4. Install the cylinder head cover. (Refer to 0110 CYLINDER HEAD GASKET REPLACEMENT, Cylinder Head Cover Installation Note.)
