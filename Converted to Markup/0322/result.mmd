5. Install the shock absorber, making sure that the marks on the shock absorber and coil spring are aligned. 
6. Tighten the nut several turns. 
7. Remove the SSTs. 
8. Secure the shock absorber in a vise.  


## Caution  


Using an air tool will damage the piston rod thread. Do not use an air tool.  


9. Apply an antitrust penetrating oil lubricant to the piston rod thread and tighten the lower piston rod nut so that the exposed thread of the piston rod is \(15.7 - 17.7 \text{mm} (0.62 - 0.69 \text{in})\) .  


10. Tighten the upper nut to the specified torque.  


Tightening torque \(16 - 23 \text{N} \cdot \text{m} (1.6 - 2.4 \text{kgf} \cdot \text{m}, 12 - 17 \text{ft} \cdot \text{lbf})\)
