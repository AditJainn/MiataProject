2. Verify that the idle speed is within the specification.  


## Specification  


750- 850 (800 ± 50) rpm  


3. If not as specified, adjust the idle speed. (Refer to idle Speed Adjustment.) 
4. Connect a timing light to the high-tension lead of the No.1 cylinder. 
5. Verify that the timing mark (white) on the crankshaft pulley and the T mark on the timing belt cover are aligned.

9. If not as specified, inspect the following.  


Camshaft position sensor Crankshaft position sensor Throttle position sensor Engine coolant temperature sensor Neutral switch (MT) Clutch switch (MT) Transmission range switch (AT)  


10. If the devices are normal, replace the PCM.  


## Idle Speed Adjustment  


1. Perform "Engine Tune-up Preparation". 
2. Verify that the idle speed is within the specification.  


## Specification  


750- 850 (800 ± 50) rpm  


3. If not within the specification, adjust the idle speed by turning the air adjusting screw (AAS).
