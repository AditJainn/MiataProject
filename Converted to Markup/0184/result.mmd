## CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM ON-BOARD DIAGNOSIS  


## Outline  


There are two on- board diagnostic functions: Operation Mode, which inspects for and indicates correct operation of the input signals to the control module, and Condition Detection Mode, which indicates troubles in the system The two functions can be done by using either of the following methods: (1) Verifying the flashing pattern of the cruise set indicator light in the instrument cluster. (2) Verifying the output of the data link connector by using the SST (NGS set).

## Inspection of Diagnostic Trouble Codes for Operation Mode  


## Note  


If an Operation Mode is not indicated, the following may be the cause of the malfunction. 1. Cruise control switch (RESUME/ACCEL switch) 2. Cruise control main switch 3. Cruise control module 4. Open or short circuit in wiring harness  


## Using the cruise set indicator light  


1. Turn the ignition switch to ON. 
2. Verify that the cruise control main switch is off. 
3. Turn and hold the RESUME/ACCEL switch on then turn on the cruise control main switch to activate system inspection. (The cruise set indicator light will illuminate for 3 seconds.)

4. Operate each switch as described in the operation code list and note the operation code list pattern. If the cruise set indicator light does not flash, inspect the corresponding system area. 
5. The operation mode is canceled by turning the ignition switch to LOCK or turning off the cruise control main switch.
