## Disconnection of the Negative Battery Cable  


Before beginning any work, turn the ignition switch to LOCK, then disconnect the negative battery cable and wait for more than 1 minute to allow the backup power supply of the SAS unit and side air bag sensors to deplete its stored power.  


## Removal of Parts  


While correcting a problem, try also to determine its cause. Begin work only after first learning which parts and subcomponents must be removed and disassembled for replacement or repair. After removing the part, plug all holes and ports to prevent foreign material from entering.

## Disassembly  


If the disassembly procedure is complex, requiring many parts to be disassembled, all parts should be disassembled in a way that will not affect their performance or external appearance and identified so that reassembly can be performed easily and efficiently.

## Inspection During Removal, Disassembly  


When removed, each part should be carefully inspected for malfunctioning, deformation, damage, and other problems.
