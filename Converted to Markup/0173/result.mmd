3. If the engine condition does not change, do as follows.  


(1) Connect the IAC valve connector. 
(2) Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2.

(3) Verify that DTC P0506, P0507 or P1504 is not displayed. If DTC P0506, P0507 or P1504 is shown, carry out troubleshooting of the DTC P0506, P0507 or P1504.  


(4) Select the "SIMULATION TEST" function on the NGS display. Change the duty value of the IAC valve to \(100\%\) by using the "IAC V" and verify that the idle speed increases. If the idle speed does not change, inspect IAC valve air passage. Inspect for open or short circuit between IAC valve connector terminals and PCM connector terminals 3M and 3C.  


4. Warm up the engine to normal operating temperature and run it at idle.  


5. Turn the electrical loads on and verify that the engine speed is within the specification by using "PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD" function.

\*1: Excludes temporary idle speed drop just after the electrical loads (E/L) are turned on. \*2: Headlight is on, Fan switch (above 1st), Cooling fan are operating, Rear window defroster is on. \*3: Steering wheel is fully turned. \*4: A/C switch and fan switch are on.  


## Note  


Excludes temporary idle speed drop just after the electrical loads are turned on.  


6. If not as specified, inspect the related switches and wiring harnesses.  


## VICS Operation Inspection  


1. Start the engine. 
2. Verify that the rod of the VICS shutter valve actuator is pulled.

3. If the rod is not pulled, do as follows.  


(1) Stop the engine. 
(2) Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2. (Refer to 01-40 POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) INSPECTION.) 
(3) Verify that diagnostic trouble code No. P1523 is not displayed. If code No. P1523 is shown, carry out troubleshooting of the code No. P1523. (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE ON-BOARD DIAGNOSIS, Diagnostic Trouble Code Inspection.)  


ON-BOARD DIAGNOSIS, Diagnostic Trouble Code Inspection.)  


(4) If diagnostic trouble codes are not shown, do as follows. 
1 Start the engine and run it at idle. 
2 Select the SIMULATION TEST function on the NGS display.

3 Turn the VICS solenoid valve from on to off by using the "VICS V" and inspect if operation sound of the solenoid valve is heard.  


4 If the operation sound is heard, inspect the following.  


Loose or damaged vacuum hose and vacuum chamber Shutter valve actuator (Refer to 01- 13 SHUTTER VALVE ACTUATOR INSPECTION.) If the operation sound is not heard, inspect the following.  


VICS solenoid valve (Refer to 01- 13 VICS SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION.)  


4. Inspect the rod operation under the following conditions.
