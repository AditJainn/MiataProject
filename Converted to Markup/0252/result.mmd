## VENT CUT VALVE INSPECTION  


## Caution  


It is necessary to install the fuel- filler cap properly. When the fuel- filler cap, except for the OES, has been installed or the fuel- filler cap is loose, the vent cut valve may not operate properly.  


1. Verify that air goes through from (a) to (b) with the fuel-filler cap on.
