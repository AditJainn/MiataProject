## TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE  


- The ABS is composed of electrical components, a mechanical component (ABS hydraulic unit), and standard system components. Fundamentally, malfunctions of the ABS electrical or mechanical components are judged by the on-board diagnostic program within the ABS control module. Malfunctions are indicated by a warning light on the instrument cluster. The technician can locate a malfunction by switching the system to the diagnostic test mode.- The on-board diagnostic system must be used when diagnosing the ABS.
