## AIR BAG MODULE DISPOSAL PROCEDURES 


**Warning** 


- Before scrapping a vehicle with a live (undeployed) air bag module, deploy the air bag module. Never dispose of a live (undeployed) air bag module. 


**Warning** 


- The air bag is very hot immediately after it deploys. You can get burned. Do not touch the air bag module for at least 15 minutes after deployment. 


**Warning** 


- Pouring water on a deployed air bag is dangerous. The water will mix with the residual gasses to form a gas that can make breathing difficult. Do not pour water on the deployed air bag module. 


**Warning** 


- A deployed air bag module may contain deposits of sodium hydroxide, a caustic byproduct of the gas-generated combustion. If this substance gets into your eyes or on your hands, it can cause irritation and itching. When handling a deployed air bag module, wear gloves and safety glasses.
