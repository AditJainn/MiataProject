If the TCC operates when driving at high speeds only, the malfunction (improper adjustment) is in the O/D OFF switch circuit or transmission range switch circuit.<br>Caution<br>● If the torque converter clutch or piston is stuck, inspect them. In addition, Inspect the oil cooler for foreign particles which may have mixed in with the ATF.<br>① TCC piston slippage, burned<br>● Line pressure is low<br>● Malfunction of throttle position sensor<br>● Malfunction of engine coolant temperature sensor<br>● Malfunction of output speed sensor<br>● Malfunction of input/turbine speed sensor<br>● Malfunction of sensor ground<br>② Malfunction of transmission range switch<br>● Short or open circuit in wiring<br>● Poor connection of connector<br>● Malfunction of sensor<br>● Selector lever adjustment is incorrect<br>● Transmission range switch adjustment is incorrect<br>③ Malfunction of TCC control solenoid valve<br>● Short or open circuit in wiring<br>● Poor connection of connector<br>● Solenoid valve is stuck<br>④ Malfunction of O/D OFF switch<br>⑤ Malfunction of torque converter<br>⑥ Malfunction of control valve body<br>Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on-board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Drive vehicle in D range and inspect following:<br>● 1-2 shift up and down<br>● 2-3 shift up and down<br>● 3-4 shift up and down<br>Are all shifts up and shifts down possible?</td><td>Yes<br>No<br>No shift at all<br>Go to symptom troubleshooting No.7 “NO SHIFT”.<br>No shift from 1GR in D rage<br>Inspect output speed sensor.<br>3GR and 4GR are only available in D range.<br>Inspect shift solenoid A and related harness.<br>4GR is only available in D range.<br>Inspect both shift solenoid A and B.<br>Inspect shift solenoid related wiring harness including shift solenoid ground.<br>Abnormal shift<br>Go to symptom troubleshooting No.9 “ABNORMAL SHIFT”.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Connect NGS tester to data link connector-2.
