## 1 Range Test  


1. Perform road test preparation. (Refer to Road Test Preparation.)  


2. Shift the selector lever to 1 range.  


3. Accelerate the vehicle with the half, and the wide open throttle.  


4. Verify that downshifts are obtained. The shift points must be as shown in the vehicle speed at shift point table.  



Vehicle speed at shift point table   

<table><tr><td>Range</td><td>Mode</td><td>Throttle opening angle</td><td>Shift</td><td>Vehicle speed (km/h (mph))</td><td>Shift solenoid A</td><td>Shift solenoid B</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>All position</td><td>1,2→1,1</td><td>35—41 (22—25)</td><td>ON</td><td>ON→OFF</td></tr></table>  


## Note  


Note- The shift solenoid electrical ON- OFF pattern in this chart describes the stabilized condition before and after shift control. The pattern may oscillate between ON and OFF momentarily while shifting- up or down.- This is normal.  


## P Position Test  


P Position Test- Shift into P position on a gentle slope. Release the brake and verify that the vehicle does not roll.  


## AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID (ATF) INSPECTION  


## ATF Condition Inspection  


One way of determining whether the transmission should be disassembled is by noting:  


1. If the ATF is muddy or varnished.  


2. If the ATF smells strange or unusual.  


## ATF condition  



<table><tr><td colspan="2">Condition</td><td>Possible cause</td></tr><tr><td>Clear red</td><td>Normal</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Light red: pink</td><td>Contaminated with water</td><td>· Broken oil cooler inside of radiator<br>· Poor breather hose installation:<br>By water contamination, problem could be occurring to parts inside of transmission. It is necessary to overhaul transmission and detect defective parts. If necessary, repair or replace transmission.</td></tr><tr><td>Reddish brown</td><td>Has burnt smell and metal pieces are found</td><td>Defective powertrain components inside of transmission:<br>Metal pieces cause wide range of problems by plugging up in oil pipe, control valve body, and oil cooler in radiator.<br>· When large amount of metal pieces are found, overhaul transmission and detect defective parts. If necessary, repair or replace transmission.<br>· Implement flushing operation as there is a possibility of having metal pieces plugged in oil pipe and/or oil cooler inside of radiator.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Has no burnt smell</td><td>· Discoloration by oxidation.</td></tr></table>  


3. If ATF condition is poor, repair as follows.  


(1) Dark color condition  


Overhaul transmission and repair or replace parts as necessary.  


(2) Light pink and/or reddish-brown condition.  


Replace ATF.
