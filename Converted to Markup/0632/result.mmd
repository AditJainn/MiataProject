9. Remove the rear window glass.

## REAR WINDOW GLASS INSTALLATION  


## Detachable Hardtop  


## Warning  


Using a razor knife with bare hands can cause injury. Always wear gloves when using a razor knife.  


## Caution  


To prevent the sealant from cracking or the glass from being pushed out by air pressure if a door is closed, open all of the windows and leave them open until the sealant has hardened.  


1. Cut away the old sealant by using a razor knife so that \(1 - 2mm\) (0.04-0.07 in) thickness of sealant remains around the circumference of the frame. If all the sealant has come off in any one place, apply some primer after degreasing, and allow it 30 minutes to dry. Then put on new sealant to create a \(2mm\) (0.08 in) layer.  
2. Clean and degrease an approximately 50.0 mm (1.97 in) wide strip around the circumference of the glass and the bonding area on the body.  
3. Securely bond a dam around the circumference of the glass 8.0 mm (0.31 in) from the edge.

## Caution  


Keep the area free of dirt and grease, and do not touch the surface or the primer may not properly bond to the surface of the glass and body which may cause leaks to occur.  


4. Use a brush to apply primer to the bonding area of the glass, the body and the molding within the region shown. Use only glass primer on the glass, and body primer on the body and the molding. Allow it to dry for approximately 30 minutes.

5. Once the primer is dry, apply sealant around the entire circumference to fill the gap between the dam and the edge of the glass with a 11.0-13.0 mm (0.44-0.51 in) high and 5.0 mm (0.20 in) wide bead of sealant.
