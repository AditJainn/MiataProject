## 13 ENGINE FLARES UP OR SLIPS WHEN UPSHIFTING OR DOWNSHIFTING  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


There is clutch slippage because the clutch is stuck or the line pressure is low.  


\(①\) Clutch stuck, slippage (Forward clutch, direct clutch, 4GR brake, brake No.2, one- way clutch No.0, one- way clutch No.1, one- way clutch No.2)  


Line pressure is low Malfunction or misadjustment of throttle position sensor Malfunction of output speed sensor Malfunction of input/turbine speed sensor Malfunction of sensor ground Malfunction of shift solenoid A Malfunction of shift solenoid B Malfunction of TCC solenoid valve Malfunction of body ground Misadjustment of throttle cable Malfunction of control valve body  


\(②\) Poor operation of mechanical pressure  


Selector lever position disparity Transmission range switch position disparity  


Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.
