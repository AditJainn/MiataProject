<table><tr><td>DTC</td><td>P0339</td><td>Crankshaft position sensor circuit intermittent</td></tr><tr><td>DETECTION CONDITION</td><td colspan="2">Crankshaft position sensor outputs less than or more 8 pulses while the crankshaft rotates twice</td></tr><tr><td>POSSIBLE CAUSE</td><td colspan="2">Crankshaft position sensor malfunction<br/>Crankshaft position sensor air gap incorrect<br/>Intermittent open or short circuit in wiring harness from PCM terminal 2J to crankshaft position sensor terminal B<br/>Intermittent open or short circuit in wiring harness from main relay terminal D to crankshaft position sensor terminal A<br/>Damaged crankshaft pulley</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
1
Has FREEZE FRAME PID DATA been recorded?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Record FREEZE FRAME PID DATA on repair order, then go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
2
Are crankshaft position sensor and PCM connector s and terminals okay?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Repair or replace connector or terminal, then go to step 8.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
3
Inspect the any damages of the crankshaft pulley teeth.
Are the crankshaft pulley teeth okay?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Replace the crankshaft pulley, then go to step 8.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
4
Measure the air gap between the crankshaft position sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley.
Is air gap within specifications?
Specification: 0.5-1.5 mm (0.020-0.059 in)
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Adjust the crankshaft position sensor air gap, then go to step 8.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
5
Disconnect the crankshaft position sensor, main relay and PCM connectors.
Check for intermittent open circuit between the following terminals while wiggle and pull each wiring harness:
● PCM connector terminal 2J and crankshaft position sensor connector terminal B
● Main relay connector and crankshaft position sensor connector terminal A
Are all wiring harnesses okay?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Repair or replace the wiring harness, then go to step 8.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
6
Check if there is continuity between the crankshaft position sensor connector terminals while wiggle and pull each wiring harnesses.
Is there continuity?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>There is a short circuit. Repair or replace the wiring harness, then go to step 8.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Go to next step</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">
7
Clear diagnostic trouble code from memory.
Is same code No. present after performing "After repair procedure"?
</td><td>Yes</td><td>Replace the crankshaft position sensor, then go to next step. If same diagnostic code is retrieved, get assistance from Technical Hotline/your distributor, then replace PCM if necessary.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr></table>
