## HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR HEATER INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Resistance  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector. 
2. Measure the resistance between heated oxygen sensor terminals C and D by using an ohmmeter.

XSU- 40WC7  


\(^{*1}\) : Except CALIFORNIA emission regulations applicable model. \(^{*2}\) : CALIFORNIA emission regulations applicable model.  


## Specification  


Approx. 15.7 \(\Omega\)  


3. If not as specified, replace the heated oxygen sensor.  


If heated oxygen sensor heater is okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Open circuit- Ground circuit (Heated oxygen sensor connector D and PCM connector terminal 1U through common connector (Front).)- Power circuit (Heated oxygen sensor connector terminal C and ignition switch (IG1) circuit through common connector (Front).)- Ground circuit (Heated oxygen sensor connector terminal D and PCM connector terminal 3V (Rear).)- Power circuit (Heated oxygen sensor connector terminal C and ignition switch (IG1)circuit through common connector (Rear).)  


Except CALIFORNIA emission regulations applicable model) Ground circuit (Heated oxygen sensor connector terminal D and PCM connector terminal 3V through common connector (Rear).)
