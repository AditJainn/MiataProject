## Note  


If the drive shaft will not come out of the rear hub support easily, install a discarded nut onto the drive shaft so that the nut is flush with the end of the drive shaft. Tap the nut with a copper hammer to loosen the drive shaft from the wheel hub.  


1. Pull the rear hub support from the drive shaft. 
2. Remove the drive shaft from the differential by using a pry bar.
