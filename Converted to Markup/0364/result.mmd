5. Turn the companion flange several turns by hand to seat the bearing. 
6. Measure the drive pinion preload. Adjust the preload by tightening the locknut, and record the tightening torque.  


## Preload  


0.9- 1.3 N·m (9- 14 kgf·cm, 7.9- 12.1 in·lbf) Tightening torque 128- 284 N·m (13- 29 kgf·m, 95- 209 ft·lbf)

7. Remove the locknut, washer, and companion flange.  


8. Tap a new oil seal into the differential carrier with the SST.

9. Install the companion flange and washer while holding the flange with the SST, and tighten a new locknut to the tightening torque recorded in step 6.

## Thrust Washers (Standard) Assembly Note  


1. Adjust the backlash of the side gears and pinion gear as follows. 
(1) Set a dial gauge against the pinion gear as shown. 
(2) Secure one of the side gears. 
(3) Move the pinion gear, and measure the backlash at the end of it.  


## Standard backlash  


0- 0.1 mm (0- 0.0039 in)  


(4) If the backlash exceeds the standard, use the selectable thrust washers for adjustment.

2. Install the new knock pin to secure the pinion shaft. Stake the pin with a punch to prevent it from coming out of the case.

3. Apply thread-locking compound to bolt threads A and points B of the gear back face. Apply approximately 0.04 cm³ (0.04 cc, 0.0024 cu in) of thread-locking compound at each point and bolt thread.
