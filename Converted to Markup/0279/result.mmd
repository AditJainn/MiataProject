## Pinion Gap Inspection  


1. Pull out the drive pinion with battery positive voltage connected to terminal S and the starter body grounded.

2. Measure the pinion gap while the drive pinion is pulled.  


Specification 0.5- 2.0 mm (0.020- 0.078 in)

3. If not as specified, adjust with an adjustment washer (between drive housing front cover and magnetic switch).  


## Starter Inner Parts Inspection Armature  


1. Verify for no continuity between the commutator and the core at each segment by using an ohmmeter.

2. If there is continuity, replace the armature. 
3. Verify for no continuity between the commutator and the shaft by using an ohmmeter.

4. If there is continuity, replace the armature. 
5. Place the armature on V-blocks, and measure the runout by using a dial indicator.  


Runout 0.03 mm (0.001 in) max.

6. If not within the specification, repair by using a lathe or replace the armature. 
7. Measure the commutator diameter.  


Standard commutator diameter 29.4 mm (1.16 in) Minimum commutator diameter 28.8 mm (1.14 in)

8. If not within the minimum specification, replace the armature. 
9. Measure the segment groove depth of commutator.  


Standard depth 0.5- 0.8 mm (0.02- 0.03 in) Minimum depth 0.2 mm (0.008 in)
