Is there any signal that is far out of specification when ignition switch is at ON, and run engine at idle?</td><td>Yes Implement &quot;01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION, Input System Investigation Procedure&quot; and repair or replace, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Continue monitoring items on previous step. Is there any input signal which causes drastic changes when it is set to be in trouble condition?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Inspect exhaust system upstream from heated oxygen sensor (front). Is there any gas leak?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace faulty exhaust parts, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Inspect installation of heated oxygen sensor (front). Is it okay?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Implement PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD (FHO2S) from DIAGNOSTIC DATA LINK by using NGS tester. Is voltage on heated oxygen sensor as follows while racing engine (in neutral)? <br>● More than 0.45 V when suddenly the accelerator pedal: rich condition <br>● Less than 0.45 V during fuel cut: lean condition</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Inspect heated oxygen sensor heater (front) and related harness, connector and terminal. <br>● 01-40 HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECTION Is it okay?</td><td>No Inspect and repair or replace faulty heated oxygen sensor (front), harness connector or terminal. <br>● 01-40 HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECITION Then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Inspect for open, poor connection and other problems on following harnesses, connectors and terminals (for fuel injector at each cylinders): <br>● From main relay to fuel injector <br>● From fuel injector to PCM Is there any trouble?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Inspect injection amount of each fuel injector. <br>● 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR INSPECTION, Volume Test Is there any fuel injector in abnormal condition for amount or condition of injection?</td><td>No Repair or replace faulty heated oxygen sensor (front), harness, connector or terminal, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Inspect LONGFIT1 and SHRTFT1 on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA which are verified at step 1. Does it shift to negative side: lean side?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Inspect purge control system. <br>● 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Purge Control Inspection Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Inspect positive crankcase ventilation valve operation. <br>● 01-16 PCV VALVE INSPECTION Is it okay?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Inspect fuel line pressure under trouble condition. <br>● 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel Line Pressure Inspection Is fuel line pressure okay?</td><td>Yes Inspect on fuel leakage and injection amount. <br>● 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR INSPECTION Replace faulty fuel injector, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Inspect pressure regulator. <br>● 01-14 PRESSURE REGULATOR INSPECTION Is it okay?</td><td>No Inspect and repair clogged fuel return hose, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Replace pressure regulator, then go to step 33.</td></tr></table>
