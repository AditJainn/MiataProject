## REAR BRAKE (DISC) INSPECTION  


## Disc Pad Thickness Inspection  


1. On level ground, jack up the rear of the vehicle and support it with safety stands. 
2. Remove the wheels. 
3. Look through the caliper inspection hole and verify the remaining thickness of the pad.  


## Thickness  


1.0 mm (0.04 in) min.  


## Disc Plate Thickness Inspection  


1. Measure the thickness of the disc plate.  


## Caution  


Caution- When it is necessary to machine the disc plate, if the disc plate is removed from the vehicle then machined, excessive runout may result. Machine the disc plate with it installed on the vehicle.  


## Minimum thickness:  


Minimum thickness:8.0 mm (0.31 in)Minimum thickness after machining by using a brake lathe on- vehicle:8.4 mm (0.33 in)  


2. If the thickness is not within the specification, replace the disc plate.  


## Disc Plate Runout Inspection  


Tighten the disc plate to the wheel hub by using two wheel nuts. When measuring runout, measure at the outer edge of the disc plate surface.  


Runout limit 0.05 mm (0.002 in) max.
