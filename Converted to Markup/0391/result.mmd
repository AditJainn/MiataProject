(4) Remove the SST from the power brake unit without disturbing the adjusting nut. Set the SST onto the master cylinder as shown in the figure.  


## Caution  


When pushing the SST gauge rod into the master cylinder piston, only use enough pressure to push the rod to the bottom of the piston. If too much pressure is applied, a false reading will occur.  


(5) Push lightly on the end of the SST gauge rod to be sure it has contacted the bottom of the master cylinder piston, but do not push so hard that the piston moves. Note any clearance between the SST body and the adjusting nut (clearance B) or between the body and the master cylinder (clearance C).

(1) Push lightly on the end of the SST gauge rod, and measure the clearance between the adjusting nut and the SST body.

(2) Using the SST, turn the nut to lengthen the power booster push rod an amount equal to the clearance measured at B.

<center>3. Adjust the push rod clearance at C. </center>  


## Note  


The threads of the push rod are specially designed so that the bolt becomes harder to turn past a certain point. This is to prevent the bolt from coming loose. Turn the bolt only within this range when adjusting.  


(1) Measure and record height D1 of the gauge rod.  



<table><tr><td>Measurement</td><td>Push rod</td></tr><tr><td>Clearance at (B)</td><td>Too short</td></tr><tr><td>Clearance at (C)</td><td>Too long</td></tr><tr><td>No clearance at (B) or (C)</td><td>Okay</td></tr></table>  


2. Adjust the push rod clearance at B.  


## Note  


The threads of the push rod are specially designed so that the bolt becomes harder to. turn past a certain point. This is to prevent the bolt from coming loose. Turn the bolt ony within this range when adjusting.

(2) Turn the adjusting nut until the SST body sets squarely on the master cylinder. (Turn only enough for the body to touch.) 
(3) Measure and record height D2 of the gauge rod.
