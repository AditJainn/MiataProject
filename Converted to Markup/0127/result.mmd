Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services:<br/>• Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel.<br/>• Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE" and "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" described in this manual.<br/>• 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br/>• 01-14 AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Verify following:<br/>• Vacuum leakage<br/>• Fuel quality (i.e. proper octane, contamination, winter/summer blend)<br/>• Loose bands on intake air system<br/>• Cracks on intake air system parts<br/>• Air cleaner restriction<br/>Are all items okay?</td><td>Yes<br/>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Connect NGS tester to DLC-2. Turn ignition switch to ON. Retrieve any DTC.<br/>Is "SYSTEM PASSED (NO DTCs AVAILABLE)" displayed?</td><td>Yes<br/>No<br/>No DTC displayed:<br/>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Is engine overheating?</td><td>Yes<br/>Go to flowchart 17 for "COOLING SYSTEM CONCERNS OVERHEATING"</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No<br/>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Inspect for cracks on high-tension leads. Is there any crack on high-tension leads?</td><td>Yes<br/>No<br/>Yes<br/>If spark plug is wet or converted with carbon, inspect for fuel leakage from fuel injector.<br/>If spark plug is grayish white, inspect for clogged fuel injector.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Inspect spark plug conditions. Is spark plug wet, converted with carbon or grayish white?</td><td>No<br/>Install spark plugs on original cylinders.<br/>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Visually inspect crankshaft position (CKP) sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley. Is CKP sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley okay?</td><td>Yes<br/>No<br/>Yes<br/>Replace malfunctioning parts.</td></tr></table>
