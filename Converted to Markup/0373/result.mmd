## PRECAUTION  


## Conditions That Are Not ABS Malfunctions  


1. Vibrations can sometimes be felt in the steering system, body, and/or brake pedal when the ABS is functioning; such vibrations are simply an indication that the ABS is functioning.  


2. The ABS warning light may illuminate under the following conditions:  


(1) When the vehicle is traveling on snow or ice with the parking brake activated or a brake dragging on one wheel. 
(2) When tires of different diameters are used. 
(3) When tires of different gripping performance are used. 
(4) When the vehicle is jacked up or on a chassis roller with the front wheels locked and the rear wheels only are rotated for 20 seconds or more. The ABS warning light goes off when ignition switch is turned to ON again and the vehicle is driven faster than 10 km/h (6.2 mph). However, diagnostic code 42 (front left wheel-speed sensor) will be entered into the control module memory. Erase it from the memory according to the following procedure:  


## ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM ON-BOARD DIAGNOSIS  


## On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) Test Description  


On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) Test Description- The OBD test inspects the integrity and function of the ABS and outputs the test results when requested by the NGS tester. If also provides a quick end inspection of the ABS, is usually performed at the start of each diagnostic procedure with all accessories off and is performed at end of most troubleshooting tests for verification of repair and make sure no other faults were incurred while servicing a previous fault.  


## On-Board Diagnostic Test New generation star (NGS) tester hook-up procedure  


## Note  


Make sure that ignition switch is at OFF.  


1. Insert the vehicle interface module and program card into the SST (NGS tester) control unit. 
2. Plug the NGS OBDII adapter into the interface module and the connector into the vehicle data link connector (DLC) located in the engine compartment via the SUPER MECS adapter. 
3. Plug the SST (NGS tester) power cable into the cigarette lighter or use a battery hook-up adapter. 
4. Listen for a double beep. The SST (NGS tester) is now initialized.  


\(①\) Activate the on- board diagnostic system and verify diagnostic trouble codes. (Refer to 04- 01 ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM ON- BOARD DIAGNOSIS.)  


\(②\) If only code 42 is memorized, erase it. If code 42 and other codes are memorized, verify the causes by referring to the applicable diagnostic chart for the other codes. (Refer to 04- 01 ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEM ON- BOARD  


DIAGNOSIS.) 
3. When battery voltage is below approx. 10 V, the warning light will illuminate and the ABS will not work. In this condition, at the moment battery voltage increases to more than approx. 10 V, the warning light will go off and the system will return to normal control. However, diagnostic code 63 will be entered into the control module memory if vehicle speed is faster than 6 km/h (4 mph) when battery voltage is below 10 V.
