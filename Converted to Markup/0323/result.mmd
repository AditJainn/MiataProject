## FRONT SHOCK ABSORBER INSPECTION  


Inspect the following and replace as necessary. 1. Inspect for damage and oil leakage. 2. Inspect the rubber bushing for deterioration and wear.  


3. Compress and extend the shock piston at least 3 times. Verify that the operational force does not change and that there is no unusual noise. (1) Compress the shock absorber piston and release it. (2) Verify that the piston extends fully at a normal speed.  


## FRONT SHOCK ABSORBER DISPOSAL  


## Warning  


The gas in the shock absorber is pressurized, and could spray metal chips into the eyes and face when drilling. Whenever drilling into a shock absorber, wear protective eye wear.  


1. Clamp a shock absorber flat or with piston downwards. 
2. Drill a \(2 - 3mm\) (0.08-0.12 in) hole at a point \(20 - 30mm\) (0.79-1.18 in) from the bottom of the tube so that the gas can escape.  


3. Turn the hole downwards. 
4. The oil can be collected by moving the piston rod several times up and down and cutting the tube at the end. 
5. Dispose of the waste oil according to the waste disposal law.  


## Note  


Shock absorber gas is nitrogen gas. Shock absorber oil is mineral oil.
