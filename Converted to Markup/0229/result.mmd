4. If not as specified, replace the IAC valve. (Refer to 01-13 IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE  


## VICS CHECK VALVE (ONE-WAY) REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Remove the air hose, throttle body, and dynamic chamber. (Refer to 01-13 INTAKE-AIR SYSTEM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
3. Remove in the order indicated in the table. 
4. Install in the reverse order of removal.

## VICS CHECK VALVE (ONE-WAY) INSPECTION  


1. Remove the VICS check valve (one-way). (Refer to 01-13 VICS CHECK VALVE (ONE-WAY) REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 
2. Blow through A and verify that the air flows from B. 
3. Blow through B and verify that the air does not flow from A.

REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) If as specified but the Simulation Test is failed, inspect following:  


## Open circuit  


Open circuit- Power circuit (IAC valve connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3M.)- Ground circuit (IAC valve connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3O.)  


## Short circuit  


IAC valve connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3M to ground.  


5. Remove the IAC valve, and inspect for any damage or clogging. Replace the IAC valve if not as specified. (Refer to 01-13 IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.)
