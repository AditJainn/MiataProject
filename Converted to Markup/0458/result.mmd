## CLUTCH FLUID REPLACEMENT  


## Caution  


Clutch fluid will damage painted surfaces. If clutch fluid does get on a painted surface, wipe it off immediately.  


## Note  


Do not mix different brands of fluid. Do not reuse the clutch fluid that was drained.  


1. Drain the fluid from the reservoir by using a suction pump. (Refer to 04-10 PRECAUTION (BRAKES).) 
2. Remove the bleeder cap from the clutch release cylinder and attach a vinyl hose to the bleeder screw. 
3. Insert the other end of the vinyl hose into a clear container. 
4. Loosen the bleeder screw by using the SST.

## CLUTCH FLUID AIR BLEEDING  


## Caution  


Clutch fluid will damage painted surfaces. If clutch fluid does get on a painted. surface, wipe it off immediately.  


## Note  


Do not mix different brands of fluid. Do not reuse the clutch fluid that was. drained.  


1. Remove the bleeder cap from the clutch release cylinder and attach a vinyl hose to the bleader plug. 
2. Place the other end of the vinyl hose in a clear container. 
3. Slowly pump the clutch pedal several times. 
4. With the clutch pedal depressed, loosen the bleeder screw by using the SST to let the fluid escape. Close the bleeder screw by using the SST.  


5. With another person slowly pumping the clutch pedal, drain the fluid from the clutch system. 
6. Repeat step 5 until all the fluid is drained. 
7. Change the bleeder screw tightening torque to allow for a torque wrench-SST combination. (Refer to 00-00 FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURES, Torque Formulas.) 
8. Tighten the bleeder screw by using the SST.  


## Tightening torque  


5.9-8.8 N·m (60-90 kgf·cm, 53-78 in·lbf)  


9. Fill the reservoir to MAX with new fluid of the specified type. 
10. Bleed the air from the clutch. (Refer to 05-10 CLUTCH FLUID AIR BLEEDING.) 
11. Verify correct clutch operation. 
12. Verify that there is no fluid leakage.  


5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until only clean fluid is seen. 
6. Tighten the bleeder screw.  


## Tightening torque  


5.9-8.8 N·m (60-90 kgf· cm, 53-78 in·lbf)  


7. Add fluid to the MAX mark.
