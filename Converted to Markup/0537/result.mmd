## Adjusting Cover Assembly Note  


1. Set the rack to the center position. 
2. Tighten the adjusting cover to \(4.9\mathrm{N}\cdot \mathrm{m}\) (50 kgf-cm, 43 in-lbf) three times, then return it \(25^{\circ}\) by using the SST.

3. Apply sealant to the threads of the locknut. 
4. Attach the locknut. 
5. Measure the pinion torque by using the SST and a pull scale.

## Standard  


Center of rack \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) 1.0- 1.1 N·m {10- 12 kgf·cm, 8.7- 10.4 in·lbf}  


6. If not as the specified, repeat steps 2 through 6. 
7. Install the locknut by using the SST (49 B032 320).  


## Tightening torque  


40- 49 N·m (4.0- 5.0 kgf·m, 29- 36 ft·lbf)  


## Hermetic sealing inspection  


1. Connect the SSTs to the power cylinder section of the gear housing. 
2. Apply 53.3 kPa (400 mmHg, 15.7 inHg) vacuum with a vacuum pump and verify that it is held for at least 30 seconds. 
3. If the vacuum is not held, replace the oil seal.
