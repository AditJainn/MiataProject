## ROAD TEST  


## Road Test Preparation  


1. Inspect the engine coolant. (Refer to 01-12 ENGINE COOLANT LEVEL INSPECTION.)  
2. Inspect the engine oil. (Refer to 01-10 ENGINE OIL INSPECTION.)  
3. Inspect the ATF levels. (Refer to 05-13 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID (ATF) INSPECTION, ATF Level Inspection.)  
4. Inspect the ignition timing. (Refer to 01-10 ENGINE TUNE-UP.)  
5. Inspect the idle speed. (Refer to 01-10 ENGINE TUNE-UP.)

## D Range Test  


1. Perform road test preparation. (Refer to Road Test Preparation.)  
2. Shift the selector lever to D range.  
3. Accelerate the vehicle with the half, and the wide open throttle.  
4. Verify that \(1 \rightarrow 2, 2 \rightarrow 3,\) and \(3 \rightarrow 4\) upshifts and downshifts are obtained. The shift points must be as shown in the vehicle speed at shift point table.  
5. Drive the vehicle in fourth, third, and second gears and verify that kickdown occurs for \(4 \rightarrow 3, 3 \rightarrow 2, 2 \rightarrow 1\) downshifts, and that the shift points are as shown in the vehicle speed at shift point table.  
6. Decelerate the vehicle and verify that engine braking effect is felt in fourth gear.  
7. Drive the vehicle and verify that torque converter clutch operation is obtained. The operation points must be as shown in the vehicle speed at shift point table.  
8. Select O/D OFF SW ON.  
9. Accelerate the vehicle with the half, and the wide open throttle, and verify that \(1 \rightarrow 2, 2 \rightarrow 3\) upshift and downshift are obtained. The shift points must be as shown in the vehicle speed at shift point table.
