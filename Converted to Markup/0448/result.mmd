## 10 FREQUENT SHIFTING  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


TROUBLESHOOTING HINTSThe circuit which is the cause is basically the same as for No.9 "ABNORMAL SHIFT". However, a malfunction of the input signal to the throttle position sensor, input/turbine speed sensor, output speed sensor (including the sensor ground, sensor harness and connector), or clutch slippage (clutch stuck, low pressure in line) may also be the cause. Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.

## 11 SHIFT POINT IS HIGH OR LOW  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS- If the transmission does not shift normally, there is a malfunction of the input signal to the throttle position sensor, input/turbine speed sensor, or output speed sensor.- If the engine speed is high or low regardless that shifting is normal, inspect the tachometer.- Verify that the output signal of the throttle position sensor changes linearly. Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are

## 12 NO KICKDOWN  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


TROUBLESHOOTING HINTSIf the transmission does not downshift though shifting is normal, the malfunction is in the throttle position sensor circuit (including the sensor ground, sensor harness and connector). Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.Note- If the malfunction remains even though all inspections have been performed, get assistance from technical hotline / your distributors.
