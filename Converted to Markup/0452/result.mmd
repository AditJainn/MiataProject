# 17 EXCESSIVE SHIFT SHOCK WHEN UPSHIFTING AND DOWNSHIFTING  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


Shift shock may worsen when the fail- safe is operating. The shift shock has worsened if the throttle position sensor, input/turbine speed sensor, or output speed sensor signal malfunctions.  


\(①\) Clutch slippage, burned  


Line pressure is low or high Malfunction of throttle position sensor Malfunction of output speed sensor Malfunction of input/turbine speed sensor Malfunction of shift solenoid A Malfunction of shift solenoid B Malfunction of TCC solenoid valve Misadjustment of throttle cable Malfunction of body ground and sensor ground Malfunction of control valve body  


\(②\) Poor hydraulic operation (Malfunction in range change)  


Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.
