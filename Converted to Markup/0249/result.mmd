## Fuel Hold Pressure Inspection  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


1. Complete the "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE". (Refer to 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
3. Disconnect the fuel pipe on the pulsation damper No.1 outlet side. Set the SST between pulsation damper No.1 and the fuel distributor as shown in the figure. Turn the lever on the SST as shown to open the fuel line. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, Fuel Pipe Removal Note.)  


## Note  


Verify that a click is heard when the SST is pushed into pulsation damper No.1.

4. Pull the quick release connector by hand and verify that it is installed securely. 
5. Connect the negative battery cable.  


## Caution  


Connecting the wrong data link connector terminals may possibly cause a malfunction. Carefully connect the specified terminals only.  


6. Connect data link connector terminals F/P and GND by using a jumper wire.

7. Turn the ignition switch to ON for 10 seconds to operate the fuel pump. 
8. Turn the ignition switch off. Measure the fuel hold pressure after 5 minutes.  


## Fuel hold pressure  


More than \(250\mathrm{kPa}\) (2.55 kgf/cm2, 36.3 psi)  


9. Disconnect the jumper wire.  


10. Disconnect the SST and connect the fuel pipe to the pulsation damper No.1. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL INJECTOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATON, Fuel Pipe Installation Note.)  


11. If not as specified, inspect following:  


Fuel pump hold pressure Fuel injector for leakage Fuel line for improper routing, kinks or leakage if okay, replace the pressure regulator. (Refer to 01-14 FUEL PUMP DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY.)
