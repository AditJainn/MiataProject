## DRIVE BELT INSPECTION  


## Drive Belt Deflection Check  


1. Verify the drive belt deflection when the engine is cold, or at least 30 minutes after the engine has stopped. Apply moderate pressure 98 N {10 kgf, 22 lbf} midway between the specified pulleys.

2. If the deflection is not within the specification, adjust it. (Refer to 01-10 DRIVE BELT ADJUSTMENT.)  


## Drive Belt Tension Check  


1. Belt tension can be verified in place of belt deflection. Verify the drive belt tension when the engine is cold, or at least 30 minutes after the engine has stopped. Using the SST, verify the belt tension between any two pulleys.
