## ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION 


### Spark Plug Condition Inspection Purpose 


Inspecting spark plugs condition, can determine whether problem is related to a specific cylinder possibly all cylinders. 


### Procedure 


1. Remove the spark plug.
2. Inspect spark plug condition.
3. Go to appropriate troubleshooting chart for further information. 


<table><tr><td>Spark plug condition</td><td>Troubleshooting chart</td></tr><tr><td>Specific plug is wet or covered with carbon</td><td>1 "Wet/carbon stuck on specific plug"</td></tr><tr><td>Specific plug looks grayish white</td><td>2 "Grayish white with specific plug"</td></tr><tr><td>All plugs are wet or covered with carbon</td><td>3 "Wet/carbon stuck on all plugs"</td></tr><tr><td>All plugs look grayish white</td><td>4 "Grayish white with all plugs"</td></tr></table>


<table><tr><td>1</td><td>Wet/carbon stuck on specific plug</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">[TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS]<br/>① Spark-No spark visible or spark weak<br/>② Air/fuel mixture-Excessive fuel injection volume<br/>③ Compression-No compression, low compression<br/>Others<br/>① Faulty spark plugs</td></tr></table>


### Warning 


The following troubleshooting flow chart contains the fuel system diagnosis and repair procedures. Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services: 


- Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel. 


- Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE" and "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" described in this manual.
