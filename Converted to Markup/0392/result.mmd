## BRAKE FLUID LEVEL SENSOR INSPECTION  


1. Disconnect the sensor connector.  
2. Connect an ohmmeter to the connector.  
3. Starting with the fluid level above the MIN mark on the reservoir, verify that there is no continuity.  
4. Remove the brake fluid and verify continuity when the level is below the MIN mark.  
5. Replace the sensor as necessary.  


(4) Subtract D1 from D2 and, by using the SST, turn the nut to shorten the power booster push rod an amount equal to the sum.
