## Symptom Troubleshooting  


## Caution  


Caution- Disconnecting and connecting the ABS CM connector must be done with the ignition switch off.- When attaching the tester lead to the harness connector terminal, the SST must be used.- Reinspect for the diagnostic trouble codes and repair as necessary after completion.  


## Note  


Note- If any symptoms have appeared in the past and are normal at present, a possible cause is a temporarily poor contact in the wiring harness or connector. The ABS CM is normal.
