Is &quot;SYSTEM PASSED (NO DTCs AVAILABLE)&quot; displayed?</td><td>Yes No DTC displayed: Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No DTC displayed:<br>Go to appropriate DTC test.<br>If communication error message is displayed on NGS tester, inspect follows:<br>● Open circuit between main relay and PCM terminal 1B<br>● Open main relay ground circuit<br>● Main relay stuck open<br>● Open PCM ground circuit (terminal 3A, 3B or 3C)<br>● Poor connection of vehicle body ground</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4</td><td rowspan="2">Attempt to start engine at part throttle. Does engine run smoothly at part throttle?</td><td>Yes Inspect IAC valve and wiring harness.</td></tr><tr><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5</td><td rowspan="2">Connect NGS tester to DLC-2. Access RPM PID. Is RPM PID indicating engine speed during cranking of engine?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No Inspect following:<br>● Open or short circuit in CKP sensor<br>● Open or short circuit between CKP sensor and PCM terminal 2J<br>● Open or short circuit in CKP sensor harnesses if CKP sensor and harness okay, go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">6</td><td rowspan="2">Visually inspect crankshaft position (CKP) sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley. Is CKP sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No Replace malfunctioning parts.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">7</td><td rowspan="2">Measure gap between crankshaft position (CKP) sensor and teeth of crankshaft pulley. Specification:<br>0.5—1.5 mm (0.020—0.059 in) Is gap within specifications?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No Adjust CKP sensor.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">8</td><td rowspan="2">Inspect for cracks on high-tension leads. Is there any crack on high-tension leads?</td><td>Yes Repair suspected high-tension lead.</td></tr><tr><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2">9 Is strong blue spark visible at each disconnected high-tension lead while cranking engine?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.<br>If symptom occurs with A/C on, go to step 15.</td></tr><tr><td>No Inspect following:<br>● Open or short circuit in ignition coil<br>● Open circuit in high-tension leads<br>● Open circuit between ignition coil connector ground terminal and body ground<br>● Open circuit between ignition switch and ignition coil<br>● Open circuit between ignition coil and PCM terminal 3G or 3H</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">10</td><td rowspan="2">Inspect spark plug conditions. Is spark plug wet, converted with carbon or grayish white?</td><td>Yes If spark plug is wet or converted with carbon, inspect for fuel leakage from injector.<br>If spark plug is grayish white, inspect for clogged fuel injector.</td></tr><tr><td>No Install spark plugs on original cylinders.<br>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">11</td><td rowspan="2">Remove and shake PCV valve. Does PCV valve rattle?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>No Replace PCV valve.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">12</td><td rowspan="2">Is there restriction in the exhaust system? Is there any restriction?</td><td>Yes Inspect exhaust system.</td></tr><tr><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr></table>
