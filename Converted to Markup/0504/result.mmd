## Radiator (In Tank Oil Cooler) Installation Note

The automatic transmission oil cooler flushing must be performed whenever a transmission is removed for service to remove existing fluid which may be contaminated to prevent contamination of new fluid. The flushing must be performed after installation of the overhauled or replaced transmission.
