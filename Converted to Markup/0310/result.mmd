## MAIN RELAY INSPECTION 


### Inspection of Continuity 


**Note** 


- Perform the following test only when detected. 


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 


2. Remove the main relay.

## FUEL TANK PRESSURE SENSOR INSPECTION 


**Note** 


- Perform the following test only when detected. 


1. Inspect the fuel tank pressure sensor for damage and cracks.
2. Vacuum hose improper routing kinks or leaks.
3. If correct the above inspect, inspect as follows: 


**Open circuit** 


- Fuel tank pressure sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector 2A through common connector.
- Reference voltage circuit (Fuel tank pressure sensor connector terminal C and PCM connector terminal 2I through common connector.)
- Ground circuit (Fuel tank pressure sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3F through common connector.)

4. If not as specified, replace the main relay, and inspect as follows: 


**Open circuit** 


- Reference voltage circuit (Main relay connector terminal A and ignition switch IG1 connector through common connector.)
- Reference voltage circuit (Main relay connector terminal C and battery (B+ terminal) connector through common connector.)
- Ground circuit (Main relay connector terminal B and ground circuit through common connector.) 


**Short circuit** 


- Main relay connector terminal A and ignition switch IG1 connector through common connector to ground.
- Main relay connector terminal C and battery (B+ terminal) through common connector to ground. 


5. Reconnect the main relay connector.
