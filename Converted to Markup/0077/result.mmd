Is there any input signal which causes drastic changes when they are driven stable for approx. 1 minute under same trouble condition?<br/>Note<br/>While EGR is diagnosing, it is normal that switches BARO V over from barometric pressure to intake manifold negative pressure, do not misdiagnose it.</td><td>Yes<br/>Implement "01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION, Input System Investigation Procedure" and repair or replace, then go to step 15.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Carry out IGNITION ON TEST from SIMULATION TEST by using NGS tester.<br/>Is EGR boost sensor solenoid operating sound heard when EGRBV is turned from OFF to ON?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Carry out IDLING TEST from SIMULATION TEST by using NGS tester.<br/>Disconnect vacuum hose on EGR boost sensor, then switch EGRBV from OFF to ON and measuring pressure on vacuum hose using vacuum gauge.<br/>Is the pressure change from barometric to intake manifold?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Inspect for loose connection, miss connection, clogging, cracking or broken on following hoses using vacuum pump:<br/>From dynamic chamber to EGR boost sensor solenoid valve<br/>From EGR boost sensor solenoid valve to EGR boost sensor<br/>Is there any trouble?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace faulty parts, then go to step 15.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Inspect EGR boost sensor solenoid for valve damage, air leak and air tightness.<br/>01-16 EGR BOOST SENSOR SOLENOID VALVE INSPECTION<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes<br/>Inspect EGR boost passage in dynamic chamber and replace dynamic chamber if necessary, then go to step 15.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Inspect for open, poor connection and other problems on following harnesses, connectors and terminals:<br/>From main relay to EGR boost sensor solenoid valve<br/>From EGR boost sensor solenoid valve to PCM<br/>Is there any trouble?</td><td>No Replace EGR boost sensor solenoid valve, then go to step 15.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Inspect EGR control system.<br/>01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, EGR Control inspection<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes<br/>Remove and clean carbon stuck in EGR valve, dynamic chamber, and EGR system passage of exhaust side pipe. Assemble it properly, then go to next step. Also clean EGR boost sensor solenoid side passage.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Clear DTC.<br/>Drive constantly under trouble reiteration condition.<br/>DRIVE MODE<br/>Is TEST # 10:41:00 out of specification on DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING TEST RESULTS?</td><td>No Repair or replace faulty parts, then go to next step.
