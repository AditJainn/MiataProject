## REFRIGERANT PRESSURE CHECK  


1. Install the manifold gauge set. (Refer to 07-10 REFRIGERANT SYSTEM GENERAL PROCEDURES, Manifold Gauge Set Installation.) 
2. Open the hood. 
3. Close all the doors and all the windows. 
4. Warm up the engine and run it at a constant 1,500 rpm. 
5. Turn the A/C switch on. 
6. Set the fan switch at 4th. 
7. Set the REC/FRESH lever to REC. 
8. Set the mode lever to VENT. 
9. Set the temperature control lever to MAX COLD. 
10. Measure the high- and low-pressure side readings of the manifold gauge. 
11. If the high- and low-pressure side readings are in the shaded zones shown in the figure, the refrigerant system is normal.

12. If the high- and low-pressure side readings are not as specified, troubleshoot the refrigerant system. (Refer to 07-01 TROUBLESHOOTING.)  


## REFRIGERANT CHARGING  


1. Install the manifold gauge set. (Refer to 07-10 REFIGERANT SYSTEM GENERAL PROCEDURES, Manifold Gauge Set Installation.) 
2. Connect the tap pin side of the charging hose to the air purge valve of the manifold gauge. 
3. Connect the vacuum pump hose to the center joint of the manifold gauge. 
4. Connect the vacuum pump hose to the vacuum pump. 
5. Connect the charging hose to the refrigerant tank. 
6. Place the refrigerant tank on the scale.

7. Open all the valves of the manifold gauge. 
8. Start the vacuum pump and let it operate for 15 minutes.
