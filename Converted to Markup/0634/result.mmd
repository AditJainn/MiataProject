## Reusing Windshield  


1. Make a hole through the sealant from the inside of the vehicle by using an awl.  


## Warning  


Using piano wire with bare hands can cause injury. Always wear gloves when using piano wire.  


2. Pass the SST (piano wire) through the hole.

3. Wind each end of the SST (piano wire) around a bar.  


## Note  


Use the entire length of piano wire to prevent it from breaking when cutting through the sealant.  


4. Working with another person, saw through the sealant around the edge of the glass.

## WINDSHIELD INSTALLATION  


Warning Using a razor knife with bare hands can cause injury. Always wear gloves when using a razor knife.  


## Caution  


To prevent the sealant from cracking or the glass from being pushed out by air pressure if a door is closed, open all of the windows and leave them open until the sealant has hardened.  


1. Cut away the old sealant by using a razor knife so that \(1 - 2mm\) \(\{0.04 - 0.07in\}\) thickness of sealant remains around the circumference of the frame. If all the sealant has come off in any one place, apply some primer after degreasing, and allow it 30 minutes to dry. Then put on new sealant to create \(2mm\) \(\{0.08in\}\) layer.  


2. Clean and degrease an approximately \(50.0mm\) \(\{1.97in\}\) wide strip around the circumference of the glass and the bonding area on the body. 
3. Securely bond a dam along the circumference of the glass \(7.0mm\) \(\{0.28in\}\) from the edge.

4. Install spacers into the hole. 
5. Temporarily install the glass onto the body and adjust the glass-to-body clearance.
