10. If not within the minimum specification, undercut the grooves to the standard depth.  


## Magnetic switch  


1. Verify for continuity between terminals S and M by using an ohmmeter.

6. If there is continuity, replace the magnetic switch.  


## Brush and brush holder  


1. Verify for no continuity between each insulated brush and the plate by using an ohmmeter.

2. If there is continuity, replace the brush holder. 
3. Measure the brush length.  


Standard brush length 12.3 mm {0.48 in} Minimum brush length 7.0 mm {0.28 in}  


4. If any brush is worn almost to or beyond the minimum specification, replace all the brushes.

5. Measure the brush spring force by using a spring balance.  


Standard spring force 15.05- 20.35 N {1.534- 2.076 kgf, 3.375- 4.567 lbf} Minimum spring force 5.9 N {0.60 kgf, 1.32 lbf}
