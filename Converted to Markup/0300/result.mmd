## ENGINE COOLANT TEMPERATURE SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Resistance  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Drain the engine coolant. (Refer to 01-12 COOLING SYSTEM SERVICE WARNINGS.) (Refer to 01-12 ENGINE COOLANT REPLACEMENT.) 
2. Disconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor connector. 
3. Remove the engine coolant temperature sensor. 
4. Place the sensor in water with a thermometer, and heat the water gradually.

5. Measure the resistance between engine coolant temperature sensor terminals A and B by using an ohmmeter.  


## Specification  



<table><tr><td>Water temperature (°C (°F))</td><td>Resistance (kΩ)</td></tr><tr><td>20 (68)</td><td>2.27-2.73</td></tr><tr><td>80 (176)</td><td>0.29-0.34</td></tr></table>  


6. If not as specified, replace the engine coolant temperature sensor.  


If engine coolant temperature sensor is okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Reference voltage circuit (Engine coolant temperature sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 2E through common connector.) Ground circuit (Engine coolant temperature sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3F through common connector.)

7. Reconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor connector.  


## Water Temperature Sender Unit Inspection  


1. Drain the engine coolant. (Refer to 01-12 COOLINg SYSTEM SERVICE WARNINGS.) (Refer to 01-12 ENGINE COOLANT REPLacEMENT.)  


2. Remove the engine coolant temperature sensor.  


3. Place the sensor in water with a thermometer, and heat the water gradually.

4. Measure the resistance between engine coolant temperature sensor terminals C and body ground by using an ohmmeter.  


## Specification  



<table><tr><td>Water temperature (°C (°F))</td><td>Resistance (Ω)</td></tr><tr><td>50 (122)</td><td>160—230</td></tr></table>  


5. If not as specified, replace the engine coolant temperature sensor.
