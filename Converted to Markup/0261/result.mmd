## TANK PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE (TPCV) INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "Evaporative Emission Control System Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Evaporative Emission Control System Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the TPCV.  


## Airflow Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Remove the TPCV. 
3. Apply pressure to port A and inspect airflow under the following conditions.

5. If not as specified, replace the TPCV. If as specified but the Simulation Test is failed, inspect following:  


Evaporative hose improper routing, kinks or leakage.
