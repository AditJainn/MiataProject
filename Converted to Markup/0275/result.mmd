4. If not as specified, replace the ignition coil.  


## HIGH-TENSION LEAD REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


## Caution  


Caution- The high- tension leads must be reinstalled to their original positions. Incorrect installation can damage the leads and cause power loss, and negatively effect the electronic components.- Pulling on the wire part of the high- tension lead may break it. To remove the lead, pull only on the boot.
