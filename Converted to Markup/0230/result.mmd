## VICS SHUTTER VALVE ACTUATOR INSPECTION  


## Simulation Test  


1. Carry out the "VICS Operation Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, VICS Operation Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the VICS shutter valve actuator.  


## Operation Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the vacuum hose from the VICS shutter valve actuator. 
2. Connect a vacuum pump to the VICS shutter valve actuator. 
3. Apply vacuum slowly and inspect the rod movement of the VICS shutter valve actuator under the following condition.  



<table><tr><td>Vacuum<br>kPa (mmHg, inHg)</td><td>Rod movement</td></tr><tr><td>Above -1.3 (-10, -0.4)</td><td>Not pulled</td></tr><tr><td>-1.3 - -4.0 (-10 - -30, -0.4 - -1.1)</td><td>Start to move</td></tr><tr><td>Below -26 (-190, -7.5)</td><td>Fully pulled</td></tr></table>
