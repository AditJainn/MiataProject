## Diagnosis Index  


- Use the chart below to verify the symptoms of the trouble in order to diagnose the appropriate area.  



<table><tr><td>No.</td><td>TROUBLESHOOTING ITEM</td><td>DESCRIPTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Vehicle does not move in D, 2, 1 ranges, or in R position.</td><td>Vehicle does not move when accelerator pedal is depressed.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Vehicle moves in N position.</td><td>Vehicle creeps in N position.<br>Vehicle creeps if brake pedal is not depressed in N position.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Vehicle moves in P position, or parking gear does not disengage when P is disengaged.</td><td>Vehicle rolls when on a downward slope and tires do not lock in P position.<br>Tires are locked when P is disengaged, vehicle does not move in D, 2, 1 ranges, and R position when accelerator pedal is depressed, and engine remains in stall condition.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Excessive creep</td><td>Vehicle accelerates in D, 2, 1 ranges, and R position without depressing accelerator pedal.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>No creep at all</td><td>Vehicle does not move in D, 2, 1 ranges, or R position when idling on flat paved road.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Low maximum speed and poor acceleration</td><td>Vehicle acceleration is poor at start.<br>Delayed acceleration when accelerator is depressed while driving.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>No shift</td><td>Single shift range only.<br>Sometimes shift correctly.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>No TCC function</td><td>TCC does not operate even though vehicle speed is increased.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Abnormal shift</td><td>Shifts incorrectly (incorrect shift pattern).</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Frequent shifting</td><td>Downshifting occurs immediately even when accelerator pedal is depressed slightly in D, 2, 1 ranges (O/D OFF switch is off).</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Shift point is high or low</td><td>Shift point is considerably different from automatic shift diagram.<br>Shift is delayed when accelerating.<br>Shift occurs quickly when accelerating and engine speed does not increase.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>No knockdown</td><td>Does not downshift when accelerator pedal is fully depressed within kickdown range.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Engine flares up or slips when upshifting or downshifting</td><td>When accelerator pedal is depressed for driveway, engine speed increases but vehicle speed increase slowly.<br>When accelerator pedal is depressed while driving, engine speed increases but vehicle speed does not increase.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Engine flares up or slips when accelerating vehicle</td><td>Engine flares up when accelerator pedal is depressed for upshifting.<br>Engine flares up suddenly when accelerator pedal is depressed for downshifting.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Judder upon during TCC operation</td><td>Vehicle jolts when TCC is engaged.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Excessive N to D or N to R position/range shift shock</td><td>Strong shock is felt when shifting from N to D or N to R position/range at idle.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Excessive shift shock when upshifting and downshifting</td><td>Excessive shift shock is felt when depressing accelerator pedal to accelerate at upshifting. During cruising, excessive shift shock is felt when depressing accelerator pedal at downshifting.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Excessive TCC shift shock</td><td>Strong shock is felt when torque converter clutch is engaged.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Noise at idle when vehicle is stopped in all position/ranges</td><td>Transmission is noisy in all positions and ranges when vehicle is idling.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Noise at idle when vehicle is stopped in D, 2, 1 ranges, or in R position</td><td>Transmission is noisy in driving ranges when vehicle is idling.</td></tr></table>
