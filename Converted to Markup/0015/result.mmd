## Fuse  


## Replacement  


1. When replacing a fuse, be sure to replace it with one of the specified capacity. If a fuse again fails after it has been replaced, the circuit probably has a short and the wiring should be checked. 
2. Be sure the negative battery terminal is disconnected before replacing a main fuse.

3. When replacing a pullout fuse, use the fuse puller.

## Electrical Troubleshooting Tools Jumper wire  


A jumper wire is used to create a temporary circuit. Connect the jumper wire between the terminals of a circuit to bypass a switch.  


## Caution  


Do not connect a jumper wire from the power source line to a body ground; this may cause burning or other damage to wiring harnesses or electronic components.

## Voltmeter  


The DC voltmeter is used to measure circuit voltage. A voltmeter with a range of 15 V or more is used by connecting the positive \((+)\) probe (red lead wire) to the point where voltage is to be measured and the negative \((-)\) probe (black lead wire) to a body ground.

## Ohmmeter  


The ohmmeter is used to measure the resistance between two points in a circuit, and to check for continuity and short circuits.  


## Caution  


Do not connect the ohmmeter to any circuit to which voltage is applied. This will damage the ohmmeter.
