## Fluid Leakage Inspection  


## Caution  


Never hold the steering wheel to the extreme left or right for more than five seconds with the engine running. This could damage the power steering pump.  


Start the engine and let it idle. Turn the steering wheel left and fully right to apply fluid pressure. Inspect the points shown in the figure for fluid leakage.

## Fluid Pressure Inspection  


1. Assemble the SSTs as shown in the figure.  


Tightening torque 40- 49 N·m (4.0- 5.0 kgf·m, 29- 36 ft·lbf)

2. Mark both hose connections to ensure that the hose is reinstalled in its original position. 
3. Disconnect the pressure hose from the oil pump. Attach the SSTs.

4. Bleed the air from the system. 
5. Open the gauge valve fully. Start the engine and turn the steering wheel fully left and right to raise the fluid temperature to 50-60°C (122-140°F).  


## Caution  


Do not let the valve stay closed for more than 5 seconds. The increase in fluid temperature will damage the oil pump.
