(5) Tighten the nut just enough so that the companion flange can still be turned by hand.

(6) Place the SST on the surface plate and set the dial indicator to "Zero".

(7) Place the SST atop the drive pinion model. Set the gauge body atop the gauge block. 
(8) Place the feeler of the dial indicator so that it contacts where the bearing inner race (side bearing) is installed in the carrier. Measure the lowest position on the left and right sides of the carrier.  


## Note  


Note- The number is inscribed on the end of the drive pinion.  


(9) Add the two (left and right) values obtained by the measurements taken in step (8), and then divide the total by 2. From this result, subtract the result obtained by dividing the number inscribed on the end surface of the drive pinion by 100. (If there is no figure inscribed, use 0.) This is the pinion height adjustment value.

## Note  


Note- The identification number is indicated on the outer side of the washer.  


2. Install the spacer, selected in the procedure above, with the beveled side facing the drive pinion.  


3. Using the SSTs, press the bearing inner race (rear bearing) onto the drive pinion until the force required starts to increase sharply.

4. Without installing the oil seal, install the drive pinion, spacer, new collapsible spacer, front bearing, washer, and companion flange to the carrier, and temporarily tighten the locknut by using the SST.
