Proper lifting and towing are necessary to prevent damage to the vehicle. State and local laws must be followed.  


A towed vehicle usually should have its rear wheels off the ground. If excessive damage or other conditions prevent this, use wheel dollies.  


## Caution  


Caution- Do not use the hook loops under the front and rear for towing. They are designed ONLY for tying down the vehicle when its being transported. Using them for towing will damage the bumper.
