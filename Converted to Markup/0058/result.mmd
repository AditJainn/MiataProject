<table><tr><td>DTC P0140</td><td>Rear heated oxygen sensor circuit no activity detected</td></tr><tr><td>DETECTION CONDITION</td><td>When heated oxygen sensor (rear) signal does not exceed 0.45 V after the engine is started, or stays below 0.45 V for 19 seconds after the engine has reached normal operating temperature, input voltage from throttle position sensor is above 0.62 V, running at 1,500 rpm or over and power is supplied to heated oxygen sensor heater (rear)</td></tr><tr><td>POSSIBLE CAUSE</td><td><br/>Heated oxygen sensor (rear) malfunction<br/>Heated oxygen sensor heater (rear) malfunction<br/>Fuel injector malfunction<br/>Pressure regulator malfunction<br/>Pulsation damper malfunction<br/>Fuel pump malfunction<br/>Fuel filter clogged<br/>Fuel delivery hose clogged or leaking<br/>Leakage intake-air system<br/>Leakage exhaust system<br/>Ignition coil malfunction<br/>Ignition control module malfunction<br/>Insufficient compression<br/>Mass air flow sensor malfunction<br/>Engine coolant temperature sensor malfunction<br/>Throttle position sensor malfunction<br/>EGR system malfunction<br/>Open or short circuit in wiring harness<br/>Poor connection of connector<br/>Vacuum hoses damaged or loose</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Has FREEZE FRAME PID DATA been recorded?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Record FREEZE FRAME PID DATA on repair order, then go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Verify stored DTC. Have DTCs P0102, P0103, P0117, P0118, P0500, P1102, P1103, P1496, P1497, P1498 and/or P1499 been stored?</td><td>Yes Inspect and repair DTC P0102, P0103, P0117, P0118, P0500,P1102, P1103, P1496, P1497, P1498 or P1499, then go to step 29.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Is DTC P0140 on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA?</td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Verify stored PENDING TROUBLE CODE. Is P0134 stored?</td><td>Yes Inspect and repair DTC on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA, then go to step 29.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Temporarily clear DTC. Verify RPM, LOAD, ECT and VSS on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA. Drive for approx. 2 minutes under same condition. Is P0140 stored in PENDING TROUBLE CODE?</td><td>Yes Trouble is in process. Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to "01-01A ENGINE SYMPTOM TROUBLESHOOTING, INTERMITTENT CONCERNS".</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Implement PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD (ECT V, RPM, TP V) from DIAGNOSTIC DATA LINK by using NGS tester. Is there any signal that is far out of specification when ignition switch is at ON, and run engine at idle?</td><td>Yes Implement "01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION, Input System Investigation Procedure" and repair or replace, then go to step 29.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to the next step.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Continue monitoring items on previous step. Is there any input signal which causes drastic changes when it is set to be in trouble condition?</td><td>Yes Implement "01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION. Input System Investigation Procedure" and repair or replace, then go to step 29.</td></tr></table>
