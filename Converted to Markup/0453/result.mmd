If a noise is emitted during shifting at certain gears only or during deceleration only, it is gear noise.<br>Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on-board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td colspan="2">INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">1</td><td rowspan="2">Inspect engine condition.<br>Is there anything wrong with the engine?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to appropriate symptom troubleshooting.<br>☞ 01-01A ENGINE SYMPTOM<br>TROUBLESHOOTING.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Inspect engine and transmission mounts installation condition.
