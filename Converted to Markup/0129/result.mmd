Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services:<br/>Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel.<br/>Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE" and "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" described in this manual.<br/>01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br/>01-14 AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td colspan="2">INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Verify following:<br/>Vacuum connection<br/>Air cleaner element<br/>No air leakage from intake air system<br/>No restriction of intake air system<br/>Proper sealing of intake manifold and components attached to intake manifold:<br/>(EGR valve, IAC valve)<br/>Ignition wiring<br/>Fuel quality; such as proper octane, contamination, winter/summer blend<br/>Electrical connections<br/>Smooth operation of throttle valve<br/>Are all items okay?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Turn ignition switch to ON.
