<table><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Inspect exhaust system, upstream from heated oxygen sensor (front).<br/>Is there any gas leak?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace faulty exhaust parts, then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Inspect installation of heated oxygen sensor (front).<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No Install heated oxygen sensor properly, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Implement PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD (FHO2S) from DIAGNOSTIC DATA LINK by using NGS tester.<br/>Is voltage on heated oxygen sensor as follows while racing engine (in neutral)?<br/>More than 0.45 V when suddenly accelerator pedal: rich condition<br/>Less than 0.45 V during fuel cut: lean condition</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No Inspect and repair or replace faulty heated oxygen sensor (front), harness, connector or terminal.<br/>01-40 HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECTION Then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Inspect heated oxygen sensor heater (front) and related harness, connector and terminal.<br/>01-40 HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECTION<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No Repair or replace faulty heated oxygen sensor (front), harness, connector or terminal, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Inspect for open, poor connection and other problems on following harnesses, connectors and terminals (for fuel injector at each cylinders):<br/>From main relay to fuel injector<br/>From fuel injector to PCM<br/>Is there any trouble?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace faulty harness, connector or terminal, then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Inspect injection amount of each injector.<br/>01-14 FUEL INJECTOR INSPECTION, Volume Test<br/>Is there any fuel injector in abnormal condition for amount or condition of injection?</td><td>Yes Replace faulty fuel injector, then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Inspect LONGFIT1 and SHRTFT1 on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA which are verified at step 1. Does it shift to negative side: lean side?</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No Go to step 18.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Inspect purge control system.<br/>01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Purge Control Inspection<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No By following system inspection, repair or replace faulty parts, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Inspect positive crankcase ventilation operation.<br/>01-16 PCV VALVE INSPECTION<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step. No Replace positive crankcase ventilation valve, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Inspect fuel line pressure under trouble condition.<br/>01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Fuel line Pressure Inspection<br/>Is fuel line pressure okay?</td><td>Yes Inspect on fuel leakage and injection amount<br/>01-14 FUEL INJECTOR INSPECTION<br/>Replace faulty fuel injector, then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Inspect pressure regulator.<br/>01-14 PRESSURE REGULATOR INSPECTION<br/>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Inspect and repair clogged fuel return hose, then go to step 33. No Replace pressure regulator, then go to step 33.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Inspect for air suction at followings:<br/>From air cleaner to throttle body<br/>From throttle body to dynamic chamber<br/>From dynamic chamber to intake manifold<br/>Visually inspect cracks, and damages, and check fluctuation after spraying rust penetrating agent, then select air suction area.<br/>Can air suction be confirmed?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace source of air suction, then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Inspect for air suction on vacuum hose which has negative pressure on intake manifold, same way as previous step.<br/>Can air suction be confirmed?</td><td>Yes Repair or replace source of air suction then go to step 33. No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Inspect fuel line pressure under trouble condition.<br/>01-01A ENGINE SYSTEMINSPECTION, Fuel Line Pressure Inspection<br/>Is fuel line pressure okay?</td><td>Yes Go to step 27. No Go to next step.</td></tr></table>
