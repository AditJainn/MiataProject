## AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. When installing the fuel hose, observe "Fuel Hose Installation" and "Fuel Leakage Inspection" described below.  


## Fuel Hose Installation  


1. Replace damaged or deformed fuel hoses, fuel pipes, and hose clamps. 
2. When installing the fuel hose onto the fuel pipe, fit the hose onto the pipe over \(25\mathrm{mm}\) {1.00 in}. When the pipe has a stopper, fit the hose until it contacts the stopper.

3. Install a hose clamp over the fuel hose within the clamp installation range as shown, avoiding the original clamp position.

4. When installing two clamps, their tabs must be positioned more than \(45^{\circ}\) (desired \(180^{\circ}\) apart.

## Fuel Leakage Inspection  


## Warning  


Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or deaths and damage. Always carry out the following procedure with the engine stopped.  


## Caution  


Connecting the wrong data link connector terminals may possibly cause a malfunction. Carefully connect the specified terminals only.  


1. Connect data link connector terminals F/P and GND by using a jumper wire.

2. Turn the ignition switch to ON to operate the fuel pump. 
3. Pressurize the system this way for at least 5 minutes to be sure of no leakage. 
4. If there is fuel leakage, inspect for damaged fuel hoses, hose clamps, and fuel pipe sealing surface and replace as necessary. 
5. After repair, assemble the system and repeat steps 1 to 3.
