## STARTER INSPECTION  


## On-vehicle Inspection  


1. Verify that the battery is fully charged. 
2. Crank the engine and verify that the starter turns smoothly without any noise. 
3. If not as specified, measure the voltage at terminals S and B when the ignition switch is in the START position.  


## Specification Above 8 V  


4. If the voltage is within the specification, remove the starter and inspect the magnetic switch and the starter. 
5. If the voltage is not as specified, inspect the wiring harness, ignition switch, starter interlock switch (MT), and transmission range switch (AT).  


## No Load Test  


1. Verify that the battery is fully charged. 
2. Connect the starter, battery, voltmeter, and ammeter as shown.

3. Operate the starter and verify that it turns smoothly.  


4. Measure the voltage and current while the starter is operating.

5. If not as specified, repair or replace the inner parts as necessary.  


## Magnetic Switch Operation Inspection  


## Caution  


Applying power for more than 10 seconds can damage the starter. Do not apply power for more than the aforementioned time.  


## Pull-out test  


## Note  


In case the battery is being charged, the pinion may turn while in a protruded state. This is normal because the current flows to the motor through the pull- in coil and the motor turns.  


1. Verify that the drive pinion is pulled out with battery positive voltage connected to terminal S and the starter body grounded.

2. If not as specified, repair or replace the inner parts as necessary.  


Return test  


1. Disconnect the motor wire from terminal M. 
2. Connect battery positive voltage to terminal M and ground the starter body.

3. Pull out the drive pinion with a screwdriver. Verify that it returns to its original position when released. 
4. If not as specified, repair or replace the inner parts as necessary.
