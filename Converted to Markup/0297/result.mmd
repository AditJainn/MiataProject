## Power Supply Circuit Inspection  


1. Turn the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect the PCM connectors. 
3. Measure the voltage between the PCM battery power terminal connectors and body ground by using a voltmeter.

4. If not as specified, repair the related harnesses and fuses.  


## Serial Communication Terminal Inspection  


1. Turn the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect PCM connectors. 
3. Verify there is continuity between PCM connector terminal 1D and DLC-2 KLN terminal.

## INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Resistance  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Disconnect the intake air temperature sensor connector.  


2. Remove the intake air temperature sensor.  


3. Place the intake air temperature sensor in water with a thermometer, and heat the water gradually.  


4. Measure the resistance of the intake air temperature sensor by using an ohmmeter.

## Specification  



<table><tr><td>Water temperature (°C (°F))</td><td>Resistance (kΩ)</td></tr><tr><td>20 (68)</td><td>2.09—2.81</td></tr><tr><td>80 (176)</td><td>0.274—0.370</td></tr></table>  


5. If not specified, replace the intake air temperature sensor. If intake air temperature sensor is okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Reference voltage circuit (Intake air temperature sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 2B.) Ground circuit (Intake air temperature sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3F.)
