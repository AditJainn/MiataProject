## Stop Screw and O-Ring (Non ABS model) Assembly Note  


1. Push the primary piston component in fully. 
2. Install and tighten a new O-ring and the stop screw. 
3. Push and release the piston to verify that it is held by the stop screw.

## Stop Pin and O-Ring (ABS model) Assembly Note  


1. Install the secondary piston component with the piston hole facing the stop pin. 
2. Install and tighten a new O-ring and the stop pin. 
3. Push and release the piston to verify that it is held by the stop pin.

## POWER BRAKE UNIT INSPECTION  


## Power Brake Unit Function Inspection (Simple Method)  


## Step 1  


1. With the engine stopped, depress the pedal a few times. 
2. With the pedal depressed, start the engine. 
3. If the pedal moves down slightly immediately after the engine starts, the unit is operating.  


## Step 2  


1. Start the engine and let it run for 1 or 2 minutes. 
2. Stop the engine. 
3. Depress the pedal with the usual force. 
4. If the first pedal stroke is long and becomes shorter with subsequent strokes, the unit is operating. 
5. If a problem is found, inspect for damage or improper connection of the check valve or vacuum hose. Repair as necessary and inspect it once again.  


## Step 3  


1. Start the engine. 
2. Depress the pedal with the usual force. 
3. Stop the engine with the pedal depressed. 
4. Hold the pedal down for about 30 seconds. 
5. If the pedal height does not change, the unit is operating. 
6. If there is a problem, inspect for damage or improper connection of the check valve or vacuum hose. Repair as necessary and inspect once again. 
7. If the nature of the problem is still not clear after following the 3 steps above, follow the more detailed inspect described in "Inspection using gauges," below.  


## Power Brake Unit Function Inspection (Inspection using gauges)  


Connect the SST gauges, a vacuum gauge, and a pedal depression gauge as shown. Bleed the air from the SST gauges before performing the following tests.

## Inspection for vacuum loss (unloaded condition)  


1. Start the engine. 
2. Stop the engine when the vacuum gauge indicates 66.7 kPa (500 mmHg, 19.7 inHg). 
3. Observe the vacuum gauge for 15 seconds. If the gauge indicates 63.4-66.6 kPa (475-500 mmHg, 18.7-19.7 inHg), the unit is operating.  


## Inspection for vacuum loss (loaded condition)  


1. Start the engine. 
2. Depress the brake pedal with a force of 196 N (20 kgf, 44 lbf). 
3. With the brake pedal depressed, stop the engine when the vacuum gauge indicates 66.7 kPa (500 mmHg, 19.8 inHg). 
4. Observe the vacuum gauge for 15 seconds. If the gauge indicates 63.4- 66.6 kPa (475- 500 mmHg, 18.7- 19.7 inHg), the unit is operating.
