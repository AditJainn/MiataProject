## Dark Current  


1. Verify that the ignition switch is at the OFF position and that the ignition key has been removed.  


2. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


## Caution  


Operating electrical loads while measuring the dark current can damage the circuit tester.  


3. Measure the dark current between the negative battery terminal and the negative battery cable.  


## Dark current 20 mA max.  


4. If the current exceeds the maximum, remove the fuse in the main fuse block and the fuse block one by one while measuring the dark current. 
5. Inspect and repair harnesses and connectors of the fuse at which the current reduces.  


## BATTERY RECHARGING  


## Warning  


Hydrogen gas is produced during normal battery operation. A battery- related explosion can cause serious injury. Keep all flames (including cigarettes), heat, and sparks away from the top and surrounding area of open battery cells.  


## Caution  


When disconnecting the battery, remove the negative cable first and install it last to prevent damage to electrical components or the battery. To prevent damage to electrical components or the battery, turn all accessories off and stop the engine before performing maintenance or recharging the battery. Do not quick charge for over 30 minutes. It will damage the battery.  


1. Place a battery in a pan of water to prevent it from overheating. The water level should come up about halfway on the battery. Keep water off the top of the battery.

2. Connect a battery charger to the battery. 
3. Adjust the charging current as follows.  



<table><tr><td>Battery type (5-hour rate)</td><td>Slow charge (A)</td><td>Quick charge (A)/(30 min.)</td></tr><tr><td>S46A24L(S)(32)</td><td>3.0-4.0</td><td>20</td></tr></table>  


4. After the battery has been recharged, measure the battery positive voltage and verify that the battery keeps specified voltage for more than 1 hour.  


## Specification Above 12.4 V  


5. If not as specified, replace the battery.
