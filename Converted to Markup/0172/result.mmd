## Specification More than \(60\mathrm{kPa}\) (450 mmHg, 18 inHg)  


4. If not as specified, inspect following.  


Air suction at: Throttle body installation point Intake manifold installation point PCV valve installation point Fuel injector insulator Accelerator cable free play Engine compression (Refer to section B, COMPRESSION INSPECTION.)  


## Note  


Air suction can be located by engine speed change when lubricant is sprayed on the area where suction is occurring.  


## BAC Valve Operation Inspection  


1. Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2.

2. Select "PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD" and press TRIGGER. 
3. Select "RPM" and press TRIGGER. 
4. Verify that the engine is in cold condition, then start the engine. 
5. Verify that the engine speed decreases as the engine warms up. 
6. If the engine speed does not decrease or decreases slowly, inspect the water hose connected to the BAC valve for leakage and clogs. 
7. If the water hose is okay, inspect the following. Air valve Idle air control valve  


## Idle Air Control Inspection  


1. Start the engine and run it at idle. 
2. Disconnect the IAC valve connector and verify that the engine rotation changes.
