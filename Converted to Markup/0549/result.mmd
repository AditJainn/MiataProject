(Visual inspection)<br>·Are piping connections free of gas leakage? (Inspect using gas leak tester.) Are above items okay?</td><td>Yes<br>No</td><td>Adjust both compressor oil and refrigerant to specified amount, then go to step 19.<br>If piping is damaged or cracked, replace it, then go to step 19. If there is no damage, go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">12</td><td rowspan="2">Are piping connections loose?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Tighten connections to specified torque, adjust both compressor oil and refrigerant to specified amount, then go to step 19.</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Replace O-ring on piping, adjust both compressor oil and refrigerant to specified amount, then go to step 19.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">13</td><td rowspan="2">Does refrigerant&#x27;s high-pressure value hardly increase?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.
