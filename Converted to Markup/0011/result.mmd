## Reassembly  


Standard values, such as torques and certain adjustments, must be strictly observed in the reassembly of all parts.  


If removed, these parts should be replaced with new ones:

Depending on location:  


Sealant, gasket, or both should be applied to the specified locations. When sealant is applied, parts should be installed before sealant hardens. Hardened sealant causes leaks. Oil should be applied to the moving components of parts. Specified oil or grease should be applied at the prescribed locations (such as oil seals) before reassembly.
