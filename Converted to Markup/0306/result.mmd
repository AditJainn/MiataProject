## HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Voltage  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Warm up the engine and run it at idle. 
2. Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector. 
3. Connect a voltmeter between the heated oxygen sensor connector terminal A and a ground.

4. Run the engine at 3,000 rpm until the voltmeter indicates approx. \(0 - 1.0V\) . 
5. Verify that when increase and decrease the engine speed suddenly several times.
