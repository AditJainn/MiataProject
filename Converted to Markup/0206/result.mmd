## Camshaft Installation Note  


## Caution  


Caution- Because there is little camshaft thrust clearance, the camshaft must be held horizontally while it is installed. Otherwise, excessive force will be applied to the thrust area, causing burn on the thrust receiving area of the cylinder head journal. To avoid this, the following procedure must be observed.  


1. Assemble camshaft onto the cylinder head, facing the cam noses at No.1 and No.3 cylinders as shown.

2. Apply silicone sealant to the areas shown. Keep the camshaft sliding surface free of sealant to prevent engine damage.

3. Apply engine oil to the camshaft and the cylinder head journals. 
4. Install the camshaft caps to the positions from which they were removed. 
5. Tighten the camshaft cap bolts in two or three steps in the order shown.  


Tightening torque 11.3- 14.2 N.m {115- 145 kgf.cm, 100- 125 in.lbf}

6. Verify that the camshaft settles horizontally when two bearing cap bolts at No.3 journal are tightened. 
7. Apply clean engine oil to the camshaft oil seal. 
8. Push the oil seal slightly in by hand. 
9. Tap the oil seals in evenly by using the SST and a hammer.

## Camshaft Pulley Installation Note
