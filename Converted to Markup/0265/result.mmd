## EGR VALVE INSPECTION  


## On-vehicle Inspection  


1. Carry out the "EGR Control Inspection". (Refer to 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, EGR Control Inspection.) 
2. If not as specified, perform the further inspection for the EGR valve.  


## Resistance Inspection  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when directed.  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Inspect resistance of the EGR valve coils.

3. If not as specified, replace the EGR valve. If as specified but the Simulation Test is failed, inspect following:  


Vacuum hose improper routing, kinks or leakage.  


Open circuit  


Ground circuit (EGR valve connector terminal E and PCM connector terminal 2M) Ground circuit (EGR valve connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 2N) Ground circuit (EGR valve connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 2O) Ground circuit (EGR valve connector terminal F and PCM connector terminal 2P) Power circuit (EGR valve connector terminal C or D and main relay connector terminal D through common connector)
