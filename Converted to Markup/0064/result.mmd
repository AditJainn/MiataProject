Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services:<br>·Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel.<br>·Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete “BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE” and “AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE” described in this manual.<br>→ 01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br>→ 01-14 AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Has FREEZE FRAME PID DATA been recorded?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Record FREEZE FRAME PID DATA on repair order, then go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Verify stored DTC.<br>Have DTCs P0102, P0103, P0117, P0118, P0122, P0123, P0443, P0500, P1102, P1103, P1122, and/or P1123 been stored?</td><td>Yes Inspect and repair DTC P0102, P0103, P0117, P0118, P0122,P0123,P0443,P0500,P1102,P1103,P1122 or P1123, then go to step 12.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Is DTC P0172 on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Inspect and repair DTC on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA, then go to step 12.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Temporarily clear DTC.<br>Verify RPM, LOAD ECT and VSS on FREEZE FRAME PID DATA.<br>Drive for approx. 20 seconds under same condition.<br>Is P0172 stored to PENDING TROUBLE CODE?</td><td>Yes Trouble is in process.<br>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to &quot;01-01A ENGINE SYMPTOM<br>TROUBLESHOOTING, INTERMITTENT CONCERNS&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Implement PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD (ECT V, MAF V, TP V, VS) from DIAGNOSTIC DATA LINK by using NGS tester.<br>Is there any signal that is far out of specification when ignition switch is at ON, and run engine at idle?</td><td>Yes Implement &quot;01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION, Input System Investigation Procedure&quot; and repair or replace, then go to step 12.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to Next step.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Continue monitoring items on previous step.<br>Is there any input signal which causes drastic changes when it is set to be in trouble condition?</td><td>Yes Implement &quot;01-01A ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC INSPECITION, Input System Investigation Procedure&quot; and repair or replace, then go to step 12.&lt;nl&gt;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Implement PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD (FHO2S) from DIAGNOSTIC DATA LINK by using NGS tester.<br>Is voltage on heated oxygen sensor as follows while racing engine (in neutral)?<br>·More than 0.45 V when suddenly accelerator pedal: rich condition<br>·Less than 0.45 V during fuel cut: lean condition</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No Inspect repair or replace faulty heated oxygen sensor (front), harness, connector or terminal.<br>→ 01-40 HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR INSPECTION Then go to step 13.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Inspect purge control system.<br>→ 01-01A ENGINE SYSTEM INSPECTION, Purge Control Inspection<br>Is it okay?</td><td>Yes Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>No By following system inspection, repair or replace faulty parts, then go to step 12.</td></tr></table>
