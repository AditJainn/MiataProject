## EGR BOOST SENSOR INSPECTION 


### Note 


- Perform the following test only when detected. 


1. Inspect the EGR boost sensor for damage and cracks. 


2. Vacuum hose improper routing, kinks or leaks. 


3. If correct the above inspect, inspect as follows: 


### Open circuit 


- EGR boost circuit (EGR boost sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector terminal 3S.)
- Reference voltage circuit (EGR boost sensor connector terminal C and PCM connector terminal 2I.)
- Ground circuit (EGR boost sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3F through common connector.)

### HARNESS SIDE CONNECTOR
(VIEW FROM TERMINAL SIDE) 


X5U14CWBO 


### Short circuit 


- EGR boost sensor connector terminal C and PCM connector terminal 2I through common connector to ground.
- EGR boost sensor connector terminal B and PCM connector 3S through common connector to ground. 


4. Reconnect the EGR boost sensor connector. 


5. If correct the above open or short circuit, replace EGR boost sensor. 


## CLUTCH SWITCH INSPECTION 


### Inspection of Continuity 


### Note 


- Perform the following test only when detected. 


1. Verify that the clutch switch is installed properly.
(Refer to 05-10 CLUTCH PEDAL REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) 


2. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 


3. Remove the clutch switch. (Refer to 05-10 CLUTCH PEDAL REMOVAL/INSTALLATION) 


4. Inspect continuity between the clutch switch terminals by using an ohmmeter.

5. If not as specified, replace the clutch switch. If clutch switch is okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows: 


### Open circuit 


- Power circuit (Clutch switch connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3I through common connector.)
- Ground circuit (Clutch switch connector terminal B and ground.) 


### Short circuit 


- Clutch switch connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 3I through common connector to ground. 


6. Reconnect the clutch switch connector.
