## REFRIGERANT PRESSURE SWITCH REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


1. Discharge the refrigerant from the system. (Refer to 07-10 CHARGING.) 
2. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


## Caution  


Caution- If moisture or foreign material enters the refrigeration cycle, cooling ability will be lowered and abnormal noise will occur. Always immediately plug all open fittings after removing any refrigeration cycle parts to keep moisture or foreign material out of the cycle.  


3. Remove as indicated in the table. 
4. Install in the reverse order of removal. 
5. Perform the refrigerant system performance test. (Refer to 07-10 PERFORMANCE TEST.)

## Refrigerant Pressure Switch Installation Note  


Apply compressor oil to the O- ring and connect the joint.  


## THERMOSWITCH INSPECTION  


## To Determine If The Switch Is Functioning  


1. Remove the glove compartment. 
2. Start the engine. 
3. Turn the A/C switch on. 
4. Turn the fan switch on. 
5. Connect the positive \((+)\) and negative \((-)\) probes of the voltmeter to terminal A and terminal B of the thermoswitch respectively. (The wiring harness connector must be connected to the thermoswitch connector.) 
6. Inspect the voltage as shown below.  


3. Remove the thermoswitch (Refer to 07-11 COOLING UNIT DISASSEMBLY/ASSEMBLY.) 
4. Connect the negative battery cable. 
5. Connect the thermoswitch connector to the wiring harness connector. 
6. Turn the ignition switch to IG2. 
7. Turn the A/C switch on. 
8. Turn the fan switch on. 
9. Immerse the sensor part of thermoswitch in a container of ice water. 
10. Connect the positive \((+)\) and negative \((-)\) probes of the voltmeter to terminalA and terminal B of the thermoswitch respectively. 
11. Inspect the voltage as shown below.
