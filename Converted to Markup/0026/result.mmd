## Simulation Test  


Output devices can be turned on and off by sending simulation command signals from the NGS tester to the Powertrain Control Module. The "Idling Test" and "Ignition ON Test" are available in this test. These tests will verify the PCM status, output devices, and related circuit wiring harnesses.  


## Diagnostic Support Procedure  


This tests the ability of the powertrain control system to detect a change in certain input devices by following the instructions on the NGS tester. There are two options: ALL TEST and SINGLE TEST. ALL TEST takes you through all the diagnostic support tests. SINGLE TEST enables you to perform specific tests that relate to the particular diagnosis that you are conducting. This test MUST follow the instructions on the NGS tester. If not, a "TEST CONDITIONS NOT CORRECT" message will appear, or else the test result will be FAULTY.
