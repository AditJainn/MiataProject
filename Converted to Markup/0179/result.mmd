## Inspection from charcoal canister to purge solenoid valve  


1. Inspect for loose and wrongly connected hoses between the charcoal canister and the purge solenoid valve refer to "01-16 Evaporative Emission Control System Components Location". 
2. Disconnect the vacuum hose between the charcoal canister and the catch tank from the charcoal canister. 
3. Insert hose on the vacuum pump. 
4. Apply vacuum to \(3.3\mathrm{kPa}\) (25 mmHg, \(1.0\mathrm{inHg}\) and they should remain at the specified readings for a minimum of 2 minutes. 
5. Return to the Diagnostic Trouble Code Inspection Procedures, and answer questions.  


## Purge Control Inspection  


1. Start the engine. 
2. Disconnect the vacuum hose between the purge solenoid valve and the charcoal canister. 
3. Put a finger to the purge solenoid valve and verify that there is no vacuum applied when the engine is cold. 
4. If there is a vacuum, inspect the following. Inspect wiring harness between purge solenoid valve and PCM terminal Inspect purge solenoid valve 
5. Warm up the engine to the normal operating temperature. 
6. Stop the engine. 
7. Connect the NGS tester to DLC-2.

8. Turn the ignition switch to ON. 
9. Select "PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD" and press TRIGGER. 
10. Select "ECT" and press TRIGGER, then verify that the engine coolant temperature is above \(60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) (140 F). 
11. Press START. 
12. If the NGS tester indicates below \(60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) (140 F), inspect the engine coolant temperature sensor. 
13. Select "SIMULATION TEST" and press TRIGGER. 
14. Select "PRG V" and press TRIGGER. 
15. Press START. 
16. Increase the duty valve of the purge solenoid valve to \(50\%\) and inspect if the operation sound of the valve is heard. 
(1) If the operation sound is heard, inspect the loose or damaged vacuum hose. (Intake manifold—purge solenoid valve—charcoal canister)  


(2) If the operation sound is not heard, inspect the purge solenoid valve.  


## EGR Control Inspection  


1. Verify that EGR valve operation (initial operation) sound is heard when the ignition switch is turned to ON. 
2. If the operation sound is not heard, connect the NGS tester to DLC-2 and verify that the diagnostic trouble code No. P1496, P1497, P1498 or P1499 is shown. Carry out troubleshooting of code No. P1496, P1497, P1498 or P1499. 
3. Start the engine and run it at idle. 
4. Select the SIMULATION TEST function on the NGS display.

5. Increase the step value of EGR valve from 0 to 40 by using "SEGRP". Operate the EGR valve and inspect if the engine speed becomes unstable or the engine stalls. 
6. If the engine speed will not change, do as follows. (1) Stop the engine. (2) Remove the EGR valve. (3) Connect the EGR valve connector. (4) Turn the ignition switch to ON. (5) Select the SIMULATION TEST function on the NGS display.

(6) Increase the step value of EGR valve from 0 to 40 by using "SEGR P". Inspect the EGR operation. 
(1) If the EGR valve is operated, clean the EGR valve and reinspect from step 3. 
(2) If the EGR valve will not operate, replace the EGR valve and reinspect from step 3.  


7. Warm up the engine to normal operating temperature.  


8. On level ground, jack up the vehicle and support it evenly on safety stands or set the vehicle on the chassis roller.
