## MECHANICAL SYSTEM TEST  


## Mechanical System Test Preparation  


Mechanical System Test Preparation1. Engage the parking brake and use wheel chocks at the front and rear of the wheels.2. Inspect the engine coolant. (Refer to 01- 12 ENGINE COOLANT LEVEL INSPECTION.)3. Inspect the engine oil. (Refer to 01- 10 ENGINE OIL INSPECTION.)4. Inspect the ATF levels. (Refer to 05- 13 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID (ATF) INSPECTION, ATF Level Inspection.)5. Inspect the ignition timing. (Refer to 01- 10 ENGINE TUNE- UP.)6. Inspect the idle speed. (Refer to 01- 10 ENGINE TUNE- UP.)  


## Line Pressure Test  


1. Perform mechanical system test preparation. (Refer to Mechanical System Test Preparation.)  


## Warning  


Warning- Removing the plug when the ATF is hot can be dangerous. Hot ATF can come out of the opening and badly burn you. Before removing the plug, allow the ATF to cool.  


2. Connect the SSTs to the line pressure inspection port.

3. Shift the selector lever to D range and read the line pressure at idle.  


4. Connect the SST to the line pressure inspection port.  


## Caution  


Caution- If the accelerator pedal is pressed for longer than 5 seconds while the brake pedal is pressed, the transmission could be damaged. Therefore, perform both steps 5 and 6 within 5 seconds.  


5. Firmly depress the brake pedal with the left foot, and then gradually depress the accelerator pedal with the right. 
6. When the engine no longer increases, quickly read the line pressure and release the accelerator pedal. 
7. Shift the selector to N position and let the engine idle for 1 minute or more to cool the ATF. 
8. Read the line pressure at idle and at the engine stall speed for the 2, 1 ranges, and R position in the same manner.

## Warning  


Warning- Removing the SST when the ATF is hot can be dangerous. Hot ATF can come out of the opening, and badly burn you. Before removing the SST, allow the ATF to cool.  


9. Remove the SSTs.  


10. Apply ATF to the new O-ring.  


11. Install the O-ring to the plug.  


12. Install a plug in the inspection port.  


## Tightening torque  


5.9- 8.8 N·m (60- 90 kgf·cm, 5.3- 7.8 in·lbf)  



Evaluation of line pressure test
