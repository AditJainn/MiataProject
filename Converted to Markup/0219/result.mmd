## COOLING SYSTEM SERVICE WARNINGS  


## Warning  


Warning- Removing the radiator cap or loosening the radiator drain plug while the engine is running, or when the engine and radiator are hot is dangerous. Scalding coolant and steam may shoot out and cause serious injury. It may also damage the engine and cooling system.- Turn off the engine and wait until it is cool. Even then, be very careful when removing the cap. Wrap a thick cloth around it and slowly turn it counterclockwise to the first stop. Step back while the pressure escapes. When you're sure all the pressure is gone, press down on the cap—still using a cloth—turn it, and remove it.- When the engine and the engine coolant are hot, they can badly burn. Turn off the engine and wait until they are cool before draining the engine coolant.
