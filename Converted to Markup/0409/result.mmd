11. When steps 9 and 10 show correct operation, the following systems are okay.  


Brake piping to ABS hydraulic unit Braking system, including ABS hydraulic unit Electrical system in ABS hydraulic unit (solenoid, ABS motor, etc.) ABS control module, its output system (solenoid, relay, etc.) and harness  


The following are not inspected with the steps 9 and 10.  


Input system and harness of ABS control module Intermittent failure Fluid leakage  


12. Replace the ABS hydraulic unit if wheels do not rotate. Inspect brake piping to ABS hydraulic unit if wheels rotate but their rotation order is not correct. Remove the jumper wire.  


## ABS Motor Inspection (Including Harness To ABS Control Module)  


1. Turn the ignition switch off, and disconnect the ABS control module connector.  


2. Connect the SST to the ABS control module connector.

3. Measure the resistance between terminal X of the control module connector and a ground.  


## Resistance \(1\Omega \max\)  


4. If not as specified, inspect the wiring harness between the ABS motor and the control module, and inspect the ABS motor. (Refer to ABS Motor Inspection.)  


## ABS Motor Inspection  


1. Turn the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect the ABS hydraulic unit connector (2 pin). 
3. Measure the resistance between terminal A of the ABS hydraulic unit connector and body ground.

## Resistance  


\(1\Omega \max\)  


4. Verify that the motor operates when applying \(12V\) to the terminal A. 
5. If not as specified, repair the harness or replace the ABS hydraulic unit as necessary.  


## Solenoid Valve Inspection Including the Valve Relay  


1. Turn the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect the ABS hydraulic units connector (10 pin). 
3. Apply \(12V\) between terminal A and D. Measure the resistance between terminal B and the following terminals at the ABS hydraulic unit connector (10 pin).
