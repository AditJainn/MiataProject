## 16 EXCESSIVE N TO D OR N TO R POSITION/RANGE SHIFT SHOCK  


## TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS  


Shift shock may worsen when the fall- safe is operating. If no diagnostic trouble code is output, the shift shock may worsen due to poor operation of the control valve body or sticking of the clutch.  


\(①\) Clutch is burned (N→D: Forward clutch, N→R: Reverse brake or direct clutch)  


Line pressure is low Malfunction of throttle position sensor Malfunction of sensor ground Misadjustment of throttle cable Malfunction of control valve body  


\(②\) Poor hydraulic operation (Malfunction in range change)  


\(③\) Idle speed is high  


\(④\) Poor tightening torque of engine mount or exhaust mount  


Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure that the on- board diagnosis and basic inspection are conducted.
