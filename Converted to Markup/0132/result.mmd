Read the following warnings before performing the fuel system services:<br/>Fuel vapor is hazardous. It can easily ignite, causing serious injury and damage. Always keep sparks and flames away from fuel.<br/>Fuel line spills and leaks are dangerous. Fuel can ignite and cause serious injuries or death and damage. Fuel can also irritate skin and eyes. To prevent this, always complete "BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE" and "AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE" described in this manual.<br/>01-14 BEFORE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br/>01-14 AFTER REPAIR PROCEDURE</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td colspan="2">INSPECTION</td><td>ACTION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Verify following:<br/>Vacuum connection<br/>External fuel shut off or accessory (kill switch, alarm, etc.)<br/>Fuel quality; such as proper octane, contamination, winter/summer blend<br/>No air leakage from intake air system<br/>Proper sealing of intake manifold and components attached to intake manifold; (EGR valve, IAC valve)<br/>Ignition wiring<br/>Electrical connections<br/>Fuses<br/>Smooth operation of throttle valve.<br/>Are all items okay?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go to next step.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Connect NGS tester to DLC-2.
