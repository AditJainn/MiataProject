## CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. 
2. Disconnect the camshaft position sensor connector. 
3. Remove the camshaft position sensor installation bolt. 
4. Remove the camshaft position sensor. 
5. Make sure that the camshaft position sensor is free of any metallic sharings or particles. If metallic sharings or particles are found on the sensor, clean them off.  


6. Install the camshaft position sensor in the reverse order of removal.  


Tightening torque 7.9- 10.7 N·m {80- 110 kgf·cm, 69.5- 95.4 in·lbf}  


## KNOCK SENSOR INSPECTION  


## Inspection of Resistance  


## Note  


Perform the following test only when detected.  


1. Verify that the ignition switch off. 
2. Disconnect knock sensor connector. 
3. Measure the resistance between knock sensor terminal A and the knock sensor body by using an ohmmeter.

HARNESS SIDE CONNECTOR (VIEW FROM TERMINAL SIDE)  


## Specification  


Approx. 560 kΩ [20 °C {68 °F}]  


4. If not as specified, replace the knock sensor. (Refer to 01-40 KNOCK SENSOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION.) If knock sensor is okay, but PID value is out of specification, inspect as follows:  


## Open circuit  


Knock sensor circuit (Knock sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 2F through common connector.)  


## Short circuit  


Knock sensor connector terminal A and PCM connector terminal 2F through common connector to ground.  


5. Reconnect the knock sensor connector.  


## KNOCK SENSOR REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  


1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.  


2. Remove the intake manifold bracket.  


3. Remove the knock sensor by using the SST (49 H018 001).
