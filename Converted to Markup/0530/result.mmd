## Caution  


Never hold the steering wheel to the extreme left or right for more than five seconds with the engine running. This could damage the power steering pump.  


8. Turn the steering wheel fully to the left and right and measure the fluid pressure generated by the gear housing. If the pressure is not within specification, replace the gear housing component.  


Gear housing fluid pressure 7846- 8335 kPa (80- 85 kgf/cm², 1138- 1208 psi)  


9. Remove the gauge set. Install and tighten the pressure hose to the specified torque.  


Tightening torque 32- 47 N·m (3.2- 4.8 kgf·m, 24- 34 ft·lbf)  


Oil pump fluid pressure 7846- 8335 kPa (80- 85 kgf/cm²,1138- 1208 psi)  


7. Open the gauge valve fully and increase the engine speed to 1,000-1,500 rpm.
