<h1>Component Tests and General Diagnostics</h1><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vibrations can sometimes be felt in the steering system, body, and/or brake pedal when the ABS is functioning; such vibrations are simply an indication that the ABS is functioning.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ABS warning light may illuminate under the following conditions:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When the vehicle is traveling on snow or ice with the parking brake activated or a brake dragging on one wheel.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When tires of different diameters are used.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When tires of different gripping performance are used.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When the vehicle is jacked up or on a chassis roller with the front wheels locked and the rear wheels only are rotated for 20 seconds or more. The ABS warning light goes off when ignition switch is turned to ON again and the vehicle is driven faster than 10 km/h (6.2 mph). However, diagnostic code 42 (front left wheel-speed sensor) will be entered into the control module memory. Erase it from the memory according to the following procedure:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Activate the on-board diagnostic system and verify diagnostic trouble codes.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If only code 42 is memorized, erase it. If code 42 and other codes are memorized, verify the causes by referring to the applicable diagnostic chart for the other codes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When battery voltage is below approx. 10 V, the warning light will illuminate and the ABS will not work. In this condition, at the moment battery voltage increases to more than approx. 10 V, the warning light will go off and the system will return to normal control. However, diagnostic code 63 will be entered into the control module memory if vehicle speed is faster than 6 km/h (4 mph) when battery voltage is below 10 V.<br><br><br></div>
