Consequently, the odometer reading can often be misleading when determining the right time to change the engine oil and filter. If the vehicle has been used in a manner which allows it to remain stationary while the engine is running for long periods of time (door-door delivery, taxi, police, utility trucks or similar duty), then Mazda recommends that the frequency of the oil and filter changes be increased as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Interval equivalent <b>[1]</b> <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  200 engine hours<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>[1]</b><span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Approximate idle time.<br><br><b>Notes on "Severe Service"</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Some vehicle manufacturers provide separate <a href="0.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> procedures for vehicles operated under Severe or Special circumstances. Other manufacturers provide recommendations for service at more frequent intervals for vehicles operated under severe conditions. For any vehicle operated under severe conditions, as defined by the vehicles manufacturer, always check the regular maintenance schedule for procedures that may not appear at the similar interval under severe service.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Manufacturer recommends tire rotation at 10,000 mile intervals under regular <a href="0.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>There is no tire rotation recommendation shown in the severe service schedule, which has 3,000 mile intervals.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>At a minimum, recommend rotation at 9,000 and 18,000 mile intervals etc., or as close to the regular schedule as possible. Depending on vehicle usage and obvious tire wear, this recommendation should be increased as necessary.<br></div>
