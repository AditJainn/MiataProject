<h1>Dealer Letter</h1>To: All Mazda Dealers<br><br>Attention: <br>All General Managers, Service Managers, and Parts Managers<br><br>Subject: <br>Recall # 88004 1999 Miata Hard to Refuel<br><br>Dear Mazda Dealer:<br><br>Mazda Motor Corporation has determined that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists on certain 1999 Miata vehicles produced from November 18, 1997 to November 5, 1998.<br><br>There is a possibility that fuel may overflow and/or spit back when refueling. This condition may be due to a sticking non-return valve in the fuel filler pipe that causes the gas pump nozzle to repeatedly shut off. These vehicles must have a modified non-return valve installed to prevent this from occurring.<br><br>Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail on May 19, 2000. Detailed information regarding this recall is provided in Attachment I, the repair procedures are identified in Attachment II and the owner letter is included in Attachment III.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>When setting appointments with the owners, please ask that they bring their vehicles to the dealership with no more than a 1/4 of a tank of fuel. This will help to expedite the repairs, as draining fuel from the tank will not be necessary.<br><br>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act prohibits selling or leasing any subject vehicles without performing the necessary repair for defects or failures.<br><br>Therefore, you must complete this recall for all vehicles in your inventory prior to sale or lease.<br><br>Please make certain that the appropriate personnel in your dealership are familiar with the details of this recall in order to respond to customer inquiries. Should you have any questions, please contact the Warranty Hotline.<br><br>We apologize for any inconvenience this program may cause you and your personnel. Your understanding and support in carrying out this recall is greatly appreciated.<br></div>
