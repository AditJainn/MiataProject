Grid line(s) that are scratched or have the silver material (which usually tarnishes brown over time) removed are not warrantable and should be addressed with the customer.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The grid line material is not embedded into the glass but is baked to the glass surface and consequently can be scraped off Inoperative lines may appear to the eye to be undamaged due to residue remaining on the glass and will require diagnosis with a voltmeter or 12V test lamp as explained in this article.<br><br>Examples of Non-Warrantable Grid Line Damage<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Ice scraper damage to grid lines<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Animal scratches on grid lines<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Window tint film/removal of the film which damages grid lines<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Stickers placed over grids which upon removal, removes the grid line material<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>License plate (steel type placed against the inside of back glass) which rubs on the grid line causing damage<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Temporary license plate (paper stuck on to the inside of the back glass) which upon removal removes grid line material<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Cargo or lumber rubbing against the glass which removes grid line material<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Cellular phone antenna installation/removal which damages grid line material<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>An undamaged grid line will have small ridges that project above the surface of the glass and can easily be felt when running a fingertips across them. Grid lines that have been "razor bladed" will feel smooth when a fingernail is dragged across the affected area. There may be some residue left on the glass that appears to be grid material but a check with a voltmeter or 12V test lamp, as explained in this article, will confirm an open circuit.<br><br>GRID LINE REPAIR PROCEDURE<br><br><b>NOTE</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Long gaps are almost always due to damage and are not warrantable, however they can be repaired. The longer the gap the more important it is to apply a minimum six (6) coats of conductive repair material with the five (5) minute dry time between each coat. Applying less coats or not allowing dry time between coats will produce repaired resistance that is greater than ohm resistance, resulting in poor defrost performance and excessive localized heating.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Repaired long gaps are generally not visually pleasing unless extreme care is taken when taping affected grid line areas.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the brown color under the grid line is damaged or missing (this is very rare), it will be necessary to apply brown acrylic lacquer touch-up paint for color match. This paint must meet specification ESR-M2P100-C and should be applied to the glass prior to applying the rear window defroster repair compound.<br><br>Service inoperative grid lines on rear window glass using Rear Window Defroster Repair 0000-88-5067 or equivalent as follows:<br><br>Surface Preparation<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bring vehicle inside and warm it to 60 F (16 C) or above.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean the entire grid line service area with glass cleaner to remove all dirt, wax, grease, oil or other foreign matter.

This area should be cleaned with steel wool or an abrasive pad to remove grime from the buss-bar. After this, clean with glass cleaner to remove all dirt, wax, grease, oil or other foreign matter. It is important that the repair area be clean and dry and have a metallic appearance. Depending on the buss-bar condition, polishing with steel wool may be required. Please note that the entire buss-bar may be cleaned to improve appearance.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>DO NOT use any type of flame torch or flame heated soldering gun for this procedure. Testing indicated inadequate heat generation at the tip and the exhaust heat can cause damage to plastic trim parts in the area.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Use only an electric soldering gun with 100 watts or more of power. Before using the soldering gun, be sure to melt a small amount of resin core solder to the tip. The solder will assist in achieving better heat transfer from the soldering gun tip to the new terminal.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The new terminal has pre-applied solder, flux and temperature sensitive paint. The paint provides a visual indication when the terminal has reached the proper temperature to melt the solder on the terminal. When the proper temperature is achieved the temperature paint will liquefy and change color. Use terminal shown below.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bring vehicle inside and warm it to 60 F (16 C) or above.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The rear window must be at a minimum of 60 F (16 C) before a repair is made.
